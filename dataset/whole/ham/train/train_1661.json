    "body": "URL: \nDate: 2002-10-08T01:21:33-06:00\nDeCSS detractors have repeatedly claimed that DeCSS needs to be stopped because \nit makes perfect digital copies of DVDs possible. Recently, in private email, \nErnest Miller claimed that doing so would be a violation of the DMCA. In this \nin-depth special report, I show that using perfectly legal, (I assume) \nlicensed, off-the-shelf consumer software, copying DVDs is easy and in many \nways encouraged. \n*Tools:*\n1 PowerBook G4 with slot-loading DVD drive (any model should work)\n1 Monsters, Inc. Collector's Edition DVD (any DVD should work)\n1 copy of Mac OS X 10.2 \"Jaguar\" \n*Process:*\n1. Insert DVD into drive. Notice how Jaguar helpfully loads the DVD Player for \nyou.\n2. Open the DVD (it appears on the desktop) and drag the VIDEO_TS folder to \nyour hard drive. Ejct the DVD.\n3. In DVD Player, select \"Open VIDEO_TS Folder...\" from the File menu. Use the \ndialog that appears to select the VIDEO_TS folder on your hard drive. \nNow the DVD plays just like it would were the DVD in the drive. By extension, I \ncould also put the DVD up on my site for you to download and watch. I could \nshare it via a P2P network. And I haven't done anything to decrypt the DVD or \nviolate the DMCA: I've used only basic tools available to all normal computer \nusers on my (I assume) fully-licensed consumer laptop. \n*Disclaimer:* Seth Schoen, whose opinion I highly respect on these matters, \nfinds it unlikely that the DVD was CSS-encrypted if this was possible. I am not \nsure how to verify if the DVD is CSS-encrypted. If someone has a suggestion, \nplease let me know. However, if it is true, then it's very interesting that \nDisney has released such a major movie without encryption.\n",
