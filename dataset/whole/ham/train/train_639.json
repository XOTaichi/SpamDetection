    "body": "\nRelated anecdote:\nI was eating in a restaurant in chinatown in Boston. The place was empty. \nThe only other customer was a white guy reading an asian-language \nnewspaper. The guy asked the waiter for help translating a word. \nEventually his story came out.\nHe had married an asian woman through one of these introduction services. \nafter about a year of marriage she had charged him with assault and left\nhim, leaving no contact information. He was hanging around in Chinatown,\nasking random asians for help finding her.\nI obviously don't know if he did assault her, but what struck me was that\nthe possibility of mutual exploitation is high.\nAnecdote number two:\nIn college I had a job as a street vendor. There was a guy I worked with\nwho was a lifer in the job. He was a noticably messed up guy. Among\nother odd characteristics he fawned on women customers, doing stuff like\noffering them flowers.\nI asked him about it. He said that he'd never had sex with a woman who\nwasn't a prostitute, and his dream was to save up enough money to get a\nmail order bride.\nI was really moved. The guy was a loon, but he wanted a companion as much\nas anyone else and he was realistic about his chances.\n",
