You\ncould however, put the files onto windows, boot onto a ILUG BBC[tm] and\nmount the fat32 partition.\nEasier/Quicker way is to get your hands on a PCMCIA nic. Also makes the\nmaptop far more useful in the long run.\nGavin\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\n for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n",
