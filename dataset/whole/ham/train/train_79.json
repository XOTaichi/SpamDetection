If \nI understand you: If I don't use the \"nomime\" => 1 option and I recieve \nMIME mail, the Mail::Internet modules become unavailable.\nUnavailable for which? MA? SA? What do these methods do? Does this \nmean my incoming MIME mail won't be checked by SA unless I specify \n\"nomime\" => 1?\nThanks,\nPhil\n",
