    "body": "Ananova:Â  \nMan admits Soham kidnapping hoax calls\nA man has admitted making hoax calls to police investigating the\ndisappearance of Soham schoolgirls Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells.\nWrexham Magistrates Court, in North Wales, heard jobless Howard Youde made\nthree calls to police in Cambridgeshire claiming to have abducted the\nyoungsters.\nHe was arrested in Wrexham in the early hours of August 16 when officers\ntraced the call to a phone box on the town's Brook Street.\nThe 45-year-old, of Queensway, Hope, near Wrexham, has pleaded guilty to one\ncount of wasting police time on August 15 this year.\nThe court was told Youde claimed to have no recollection of making the calls\nhaving been drinking all day.\nDefence lawyer Mark Arden says the offence was neither premeditated nor\ncalculated but added that this was no excuse.\nHe said: \"What he's done is horrific. It's unforgivable. The distress he's\ncaused the families is unacceptable.\"\nYoude has been released on unconditional bail until November 7 when he will\nbe sentenced.\nThe hearing has been adjourned for pre-sentence reports although the\ndefendant has been warned custody is an option.\nStory filed: 12:36 Monday 7th October 2002\n------------------------ Yahoo!
