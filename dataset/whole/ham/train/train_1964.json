    "body": "I like this part - sounds like httpd on the client...\n\"Once the Client Component is installed, a server can order a program to run\non the client. Any CGI script, Java servlet, ASP component, etc. could be\nrun on the client. This is like breaking the Web server into two parts.\nOriginally, Web servers just understood HTTP and sent pages. Then the field\nstarted demanding more from the Web and the servers got loaded down with CGI\nand mod_perl and active pages and stuff. So now the Web server can choose to\ngo back to simple serving and (where the application is appropriate) let the\nclient do the other razzamatazz. This is superior to JavaScript in one\nimportant detail: the program doesn't have to reload when a new page is\nloaded, as JavaScript functions do.\nAnd because XDegrees uses Web-compatible technology, users can access\nXDegrees resources without installing any software, simply by using their\nbrowser.\"\n===\n\"Scaling is the main question that comes to mind when somebody describes a\nnew naming and searching system. CEO Michael Tanne claims to have figured\nout mathematically that the system can scale up to millions of users and\nbillions of resources. Scaling is facilitated by the careful location of\nservers (XDegrees will colocate servers at key routing points, as Akamai\ndoes), and by directing clients to the nearest server as their default\n\"home\" server. Enterprise customers can use own servers to manage in-house\napplications.\"\n\"Files can be cached on multiple systems randomly scattered around the\nInternet, as with Napster or Freenet. In fact, the caching in XDegrees is\nmore sophisticated than it is on those systems: users with high bandwidth\nconnections can download portions, or \"stripes,\" of a file from several\ncached locations simultaneously. The XDegrees software then reassembles\nthese stripes into the whole file and uses digital signatures to verify that\nthe downloaded file is the same as the original. A key component of this\ndigital signature is a digest of the file, which is stored as an HTTP header\nfor the file.\"\n",
