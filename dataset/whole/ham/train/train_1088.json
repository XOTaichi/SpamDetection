    "subject": "Colonial Script ...",
    "body": "Oh, they were plenty upset about the tea taxes.\nBut the crack down on colonial script certainly screwed over the\nAmerican Colonies. And, BTW, England as well.\nDear Ben Franklin was right for the wrong reasons. First of all the\ncolonies were not prosperous compared to England proper. Second, the\nissuance of colonial script had nothing to do with full employeement.\n(In fact, it is almost inconceivable he would make that claim. It\nsounds like a modern Keynsian was creating an urban legend.)\nOTOH the lack of sufficient circulating monetary instruments was\neconomically crippling. Imagine trying to buy your supplies by offering\nIOUs on your own name -- and then trying to market / exchange the paper\nas the merchant who took the IOU.\n===========================\nThe most common problem in the world is when a government prints too\nmuch money. The effects are a complete disaster. There are a lot of\nincentives that push governments into doing this even though it is\nincredibly stupid.\nSo almost all the literature talks about that.\nBut you can ALSO screw an economy over by taking all the money out of\ncirculation. The fundamental cause of the American Great Depression was\nexactly this, courtesy of the Federal Reserve Board.\nI don't think shifting the power to print money to the bank of Canada\nhad much effect. And Canada is still a prosperous country.\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of\nGary\n> Lawrence Murphy\n> Sent: Saturday, September 21, 2002 7:31 AM\n> To: Mr. FoRK\n> Cc: fork@example.com\n> Subject: Re: sed /s/United States/Roman Empire/g\n> \n> >>>>> \"f\" == fork list <Mr.> writes:\n> \n> f> \"Free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift\n> f> whole societies out of poverty\" I'm not a\n> f> socio-political/history buff - does anybody have some clear\n> f> examples?\n> \n> China?
