Anyone have hints on this issue ?\nWhat do you mean by \"CD-Key or the like\" (I presume that \"of\" was a\ntypo)? And what do you mean by \"unbreakable\"?\nYou need to be far more explicit about the problem which you wish to\nsolve, and about the constraints involved.\nSome general points:\n1. For a conventional \"CD key\" system, where the actual CDs are\nmass-produced (where you have many identical CDs), and the entire\nsystem has to work offline, you cannot solve the problem of valid keys\nbeing \"traded\" (e.g. included along with bootleg copies of the\nproduct).\nIf there's an online element involved, you can \"tie\" keys to a\nspecific hardware configuration, as is done (AFAIK) for Windows XP's\n\"product activation\".\n2. Anything which uses a symmetric cipher (or hash) is bound to be\nvulnerable to reverse engineering of the validation routines within\nthe executable.\n3. Ultimately, any software mechanism will be vulnerable to\n\"cracking\", i.e. modifying the software to disable or circumvent the\nvalidation checks.\nThis can only be prevented by the use of trusted hardware (e.g. a\nPalladium-style system).\nMost significantly, the data must be supplied in a form which is only\naccessible by that hardware. If anyone can get at the data in a\nmeaningful (i.e. unencrypted) form, they can extract the useful parts\nand discard the rest (i.e. any associated protection mechanisms).\nIOW, you have to \"keep the genie in the bottle\" at all times. If the\ndata can be got at just once (even if it requires the use of dedicated\nhardware such as a bus analyser), it can then be duplicated and\ndistributed without limit.\n-- \nGlynn Clements <glynn.clements@virgin.net>\n",
