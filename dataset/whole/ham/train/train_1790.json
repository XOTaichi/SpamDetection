My recollection about the first message being valid\nis that the ftoc code wants to find that message to start its highlighting,\nfor example, or you are selecting a message to display.\n > It may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current\n > folder (though that would then need to be verified against changes to the\n > directory). Does tcl have a directory read function? I assume so...\nglob -nocomplain $mhProfile(path)/$folder *\nwill return an unsorted list of the directory's contents.\nBut the thought of keeping an in memory list of valid messages is not fun.\nExmh already maintains in-core lists of messages in sequences, which is\nalready pretty tricky\n > Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the\n > context file) but I'm not sure how frequently that one is called.\nIn some places I maintain caches of files by checking their modify time,\nbut the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them to\ncheck their date stamp, you could just read them again. Also, now that\nwe checkpoint message state on every message view, that file will change\nevery time. In the old days exmh used to cache a bunch of state about\nthe folder.\n--\nBrent Welch\nSoftware Architect, Panasas Inc\nPioneering the World's Most Scalable and Agile Storage Network\nwelch@panasas.com\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-workers mailing list\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\n",
