He did\nconfirm that problems had spread beyond the east coast and are now seen\nnationwide through out their network. They are currently working with\ntheir hardware vendor to try and isolate the issue.\nA large number of Internap's connections to UUnet remain shutdown and\ntraffic is being routed over alternate providers. The scale of this\noutage is causing a large number of peering points with UUnet and other\nproviders to be flooded due to the large traffic shifts.\nIf you have problems reaching specific sites please send an email to\nnoc@internap.com containing a traceroute and source/destination IP\naddresses and we will investigate. If it is possible will will attempt to\nmove specific prefixes onto an alternate provider leaving an Internap PNAP\nif that will provide better performance.\nRegards,\nAndrew\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nAndrew Dul Network Operations Center\nInterNAP Network Services E-Mail: noc@internap.com\nandrew@internap.com 206.256.9500 - 1.877.THE.INOC\nThe contents of this email message are confidential and proprietary.\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nDate: Thu, 3 Oct 2002 08:51:26 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: Andrew Dul <andrew@internap.com>\nSubject: [EVENT NOTIFICATION] UUnet North American Backbone Problems\n [TIX106448]\nUUnet is currently experiencing a large number of problems in their North\nAmerican backbone.
