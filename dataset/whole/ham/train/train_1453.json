(It's code that I moved from mh.tcl to \nsequences.tcl and back again). I'm no5 sure either, but it should be a \none-time penalty because the sequence will be re-written with the bad messages \nremoved.

Look for the \n\"Exmh_Debug Reading $filename\" output in the debug log to see when sequences \nare actually reread from disk.\nMy theory is that Ftoc_ShowSequences is being called too often.
