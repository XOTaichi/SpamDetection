    "body": "\nTuesday, 8 October, 2002, 07:55 GMT 08:55 UK\nLennon killer seeks parole again\nThe man who shot dead former Beatle John Lennon is making another bid for\nearly release from prison - the day before what would have been Lennon's\n62nd birthday.\nMark David Chapman, 47, was jailed for life after he admitted killing the\nsuperstar outside his New York apartment building in 1980.\nIt is the second time in two years that Chapman has sought parole from\nAttica state prison.\nAt a 2000 hearing, he argued that he was no longer a danger to society and\nhad overcome the psychological problems which led him to shoot the\nex-Beatle.\nChapman had said that a voice in his head told him to shoot the star.\nShot dead\nLennon was shot four times as he emerged from a limousine outside his New\nYork City apartment on 8 December 1980.\nHe and his wife Yoko Ono were returning from a late-night recording session\nduring which time they had been working on Walking on Thin Ice.\nOnly hours before the shooting, Chapman - who had come to New York from\nHawaii - was photographed with the singer outside the same building as\nLennon signed a copy of his album Double Fantasy for him.\nThe killer said Lennon had been just \"a picture on an album cover\" to him\nbefore the shooting.\n'Deserved death'\nChapman has said that he should have received the death penalty for his\ncrime.\nLennon's widow told the 2000 parole hearing that she would not feel safe if\nChapman were released.\nLennon's songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney propelled the\nLiverpool-based pop group to international stardom and unparalleled\ncommercial success.\nThe Beatles front man, peace campaigner, and all-round iconoclast, would\nhave been 62 on Wednesday.\n------------------------ Yahoo!
