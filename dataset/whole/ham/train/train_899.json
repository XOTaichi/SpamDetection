But random violence \nis entertainment and intrigue.\nA couple of ex-FBI \"consultants\" speaking on the shootings in DC were \nquoted as saying the shooters, presumed to be a pair, were getting a \n\"heroin-like high\" from each successful kill and that they \"for \nwhatever reason decided to level the playing field, thumbing their nose \nat law enforcement and society.\"\nSee?
