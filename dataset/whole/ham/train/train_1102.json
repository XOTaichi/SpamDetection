    "body": "\nXviD [1] is a project to make GPL divx codecs. Sigma Designs [1] is a\ncompany looking to put out hardware to playback, amongst other things,\ndivx files. Problem is Sigma is using XviDs gpled code in ways not very\ngpl. The results....XviD stops work on thier code and ask the users to\nput preasure on Sigma to honor the GPL.\nSome notes from other places....\n>>From Doom9 [3]\n\"XviD development has been stopped! The Sigma Designs REALMagic MPEG-4\nVideo Codec contains wide portions of code taken from the XviD project.\nSoon after the initial release of the REALMagic codec the XviD developers\nhave contacted Sigma and informed them about the GPL violation (for those\nwho don't know, XviD is distributed under the GNU Public License - GPL -\nwhich demands that if you modify a GPL program you have to release it\nunder the GPL, which in this case means that the source code of the Sigma\ncodec must be freely available). Sigma promised to replace the stolen\ncode, but the new version of the codec which was released this month only\ndisguises the stolen code, it was not actually removed. Sigma was once\nagain contacted and asked to remove the offending code but until today\nnothing has happened. Therefore the XviD team is now turning to the public\nin the hope to receive wide public support in their efforts to convince\nSigma Designs to respect the terms of the GPL. And until the matter has\nbeen resolved XviD development will not continue.\nThat being said I hope all the forum members who saw their threads about\nthe Sigma Codecs being closed will understand our motivation now.\nInternally we already knew what was going on but since the XviD authors\nfirst wanted to try and resolve this internally we respected their wishes\nand kept quiet about the matter at hand.\n[Update] Sigma has issued a press release announcing the availability of\nthe source code of their MPEG-4 codec and it's already up for download.\nHowever, not a word was lost about the XviD issue and the press release\nmakes one think that the Sigma codec was entirely developed by Sigma so we\nmight be hearing more about this.\n[Update] I found a GPL notice in some of the source code files, but it\nalso looks like Sigma placed their own copyright lines there and XviD\ndoesn't get any credit in the source either. The GPL notice also collides\nwith Sigma's Software Licensing Agreement that you have to sign before\ndownloading codec or source. On on the same issue DivXNetworks said they'd\nfully support XviD in this issue and apparently DXn's relationship with\nSigma didn't really work out either, as Sigma's Xcard is not as DivX\ncompatible as it was advertised.\n[Update]First an update on the XviD situation. The release of the Sigma\nsource code does not mean it's all over, it's far from being over. The\nlicense agreement which you have to agree to before you can download, and\ninstall the codec is not compatible with the GPL. Furthermore, it can now\nclearly be seen (download the source code and have a look for yourself)\nthat the Sigma codec is pretty much a copy of the XviD codec, but all the\ncopyright notices of the original developers have been removed and\nreplaced. This does not only violate the GPL but copyright laws - you\ncan't just take a program, change a few lines and change the copyright\nstatements, you only have copyright protection for the parts you wrote on\nyour own. And related to this the Sigma codec also contains code taken\nfrom the OpenDivX project, the files were outfitted with 2 different\ncopyright notices which is quite funny.\"\n[1] \n[2] \n[3] \n",
