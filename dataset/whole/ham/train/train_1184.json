Instead, I will simply take this opportunity to \nquote the original _Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead_, the excellent \nplay by Tom Stoppard which I keep nestled in my one remaining bookshelf[2] \nbetween the _Tao Te Ching_ and Roald Dahl's _Charlie and the Chocolate Factory_\n. \n Guil: Exactly, it's a matter of asking the right questions and giving away \n as little as we can. It's a game.\n Ros: And then we can go?\n Guil: And receive such thanks as fits a king's remembrance.\n Ros: I like the sound of that. Waht do you think he meant by remembrance?\n Guil: He doesn't forget his friends.\n Ros: Would you care to estimate?\n Guil: Difficult to say, really&#8212;some kings tend to be amnesiac, others \n I suppose&#8212;the opposite, whatever that is...\n Ros: Yes&#8212;but&#8212;\n Guil: Elephantine... ?\n Ros: Not how long&#8212;how much?\n Guil: _Retentive_&#8212;he's a very retentive king, a royal retainer...\n Ros: What are you playing at?\n Guil: Words, words. They're all we have to go on. \n[1] \n[2] \n",
