    "body": "URL: \nDate: 2002-09-25T00:38:31-05:00\n_Anil Dash_: XML version 1.0[1]. &#8220;Why isn't there a way to syndicate my \nwords without butchering the way they look?&#8221; Several people protested \nlast week by changing their weblog templates to something like this[2]. Jason \nLevine has more links[3] to those involved. I spoke with one of the people who \nimplemented it, and she claims it wasn't a protest as such, more of an inside \njoke. Point taken: the entire point of an aggregator (and syndication in \ngeneral) is to make everyone's words look the same. Counterpoint: the default \nin most weblog systems is to only publish excerpts in RSS feeds; nobody's \nforcing you to publish full posts. This would probably be a good place to \ninsert a Zen quote about attachment, but my mind is too fuzzy to find it. \n_Timothy Appnel_: More FFKAR, RDF, and FOAF[4]. FFKAR is &#8220;the format \nformerly known as RSS&#8221;. Sam has already implemented it[5]. \n_Nicholas Avenell_: ESF[6]. &#8220;Are you also fed up with the continuing war \nbetween RSS 0.9* and 1.0 and 2.0 and whatever else they invent today? Me too. \nSo today I invented the Epistula Syndication Format. ESF. It isn't XML. It \nisn't RDF. It's just data.&#8221; Sam[7] would love it, then. But Movable Type \ndoesn't support outputting dates in Unix timestamp format[8], which could be an \nimpediment to mainstream acceptance. \n_Shelley Powers_: Consumer Rights and RSS[9]. &#8220;I'm not buying into RSS \n0.9x. I'm not buying into RSS 2.0. I'm not buying into RSS 1.0. I changed my \nRSS 0.91 and RSS 1.0 templates to read the following:&#8221; \n *RSS not supported here* \n This weblog does not support RSS 0.9x, RSS 2.0, or RSS 1.0. If you wish to \n view entries, may I suggest that you visit the weblog, and save your fast \n skimming for the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. \nI'm sure this is some sort of DMCA violation or something, but here goes: \n import urllib, re; print \"\\n TITLE: Burningbird\n \\n en-us\\n \\n\" + \"\\n\".join([\"TITLE: %s\n %s\" % t for t in re.compile(r'dc:title=\"(.*?)\"\\s*dc:identifier=\"(.*?)\"', \n re.DOTALL).findall(urllib.urlopen(' \n + \"\" \n[1] \n[2] \n[3] \n[4] \n[5] \n[6] \n[7] \n[8] tag formats\n[9] \n",
