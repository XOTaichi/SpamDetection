Hettinga\" <rah@shipwright.com>\nSubject: Re: Electric car an Edsel...\nDate: Tue, 3 Sep 2002 22:49:20 -0600\nBob,\nThis capacitor drive idea isn't completely stupid, but neither is it well\nthought out.\nMaxwell ( makes and sells high energy density capacitors,\ncalled ultracapacitors. They deliver them in an air-cooled, voltage\nregulated module that will charge to 42 V and hold 128 kilojoules -- roughly\nthe energy in 2 teaspoons of sugar or a bite of a donut -- and weighs 16\nkilograms. If that electrical energy could all be converted to kinetic\nenergy, there's enough to get the capacitor module up to about 200 mph -- in\na vacuum.\nSuppose you take the entire power density of the capacitor module -- 2.8\nkw/kg (~4 hp/kg!) -- and punch it through an electric motor. How much does\nthe 64 hp electric motor weigh? If it were as little as 50 kg -- and I bet\nit isn't -- that capacitor and motor would have a top speed of 100 mph --\nthe speed at which their energy is the 128 kJ that was initially stored\nelectrically in the capacitor. And it's not at all obvious that the torque\nvs. speed characteristic of 42 V DC motors will support this, or how they do\nit without wheels, drive train, etc.\nBut if they can, they can only do it in a vacuum where there is no drag!\nOn to the Lunarnationals? Or would you prefer the bite of donut?\n<Somebody's .sig>\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: \"R. A.
