    "body": "URL: \nDate: Not supplied\n[IMG: I often carry my ukulele with me \non planes. The case is so little it can fit in my suit case. I missed a great \nphoto opportunity when I was in the airport a couple of weeks ago, and saw \nsomeone checking on a standup bass fiddle. It was in a huge plastic Darth Vader \nshipping case. The _buckles_ on the thing were about the size of my uke. I \nshould have taken a picture of my uke and the bass side-by-side. Anyway, here's \na stand-up bass that looks much more portable: the Kona Walkingstick. You still \nneed to carry around an amp, though.
