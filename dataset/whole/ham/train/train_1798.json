Someone is speaking and\na group of selfish bastards only interested in getting their rocks off are\ntrying to shout him down (they are doing it because 'it's good for the\nsoul'. Kind like Chuckie Manson doing the stuff he did cause 'it was good\nfor his soul'). Unprincipled and evil. It's got nothing to do with throwing\ntea in the harbor or the DoI.\nBill\n",
