This will \nbe a Geek Purity Test question someday. Onward: \n- _Phil Ringnalda_: Fun with RDF[1]. &#8220;RDF can actually be fun, as long as \nyou don't foolishly invest too much ego in trying to store RSS 1.0, or wander \noff into flame wars.&#8221; From which we find: \n- _Shelley Powers_: The RDF Query-O-Matic[2], and The RDF Query-O-Matic \nexplained[3]. &#8220;The Query-o-Matic accepts the name of an RDF file (any \nvalid RDF file), and an RDFQL (RDF Query Language) query, and will print out a \ntest value found as a result of that query.&#8221; \n- _Marcus Campbell_: &#8220;My FOAF autocreation script is moving along nicely\n[4]. It's now looping through my OPML blogroll file, checking the first load of \nbites in people's pages for head linked FOAF files, grabbing certain elements \nfrom these files (if they have one) and spitting them out into a brand new FOAF \nfile for me.&#8221; \n- _Joe Gregorio_: The Well-Formed Web[5]. &#8220;After spending some time \nbadgering poor Bill Kearney for a concrete benefit of having RDF in RSS 1.0 and \nnot getting a really satisfactory answer I went back and read Paul Ford's essay \nagain. I wanted to get that old religious feeling back again. It didn't work. \nThe magic was gone.&#8221; \n[1] \n[2] \n[3] \n[4] \n[5] \n",
