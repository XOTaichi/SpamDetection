On the receiving side,\nmy email client distinguishes between messages\nthat are read, and messages that are not. I like\nto mark or save messages that are particularly\ninterresting or important to me. And even if I\nmake a point to delete \"suspicious material\"\nimmediately upon reading it, even THAT might\nleave an interesting kind of trace on my machine.\nSorry, but I don't buy the argument that spam\nprotects people who want to distribute or see\nmaterial the government disapproves.\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: \n",
