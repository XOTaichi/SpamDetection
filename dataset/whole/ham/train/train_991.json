My sinus infection, which appeared to be gone, flared up again over \nthe weekend in the nastiest way, and I am now coughing up dark mucus and doing \nother things that probably don't bear repeating in a public forum. I have the \n10:15 doctor's appointment that I should have made last round, had I not \nconvinced myself that &#8220;it's not that bad&#8221; and trudged through it \nall without prescription drugs. I'm not making the same mistake this time. I'll \nbe back this afternoon. \nMy email problems of yesterday have been resolved. You can once again reach me \nat my normal address, f8dy@diveintomark.org. \nKevin Burton[1] emailed me with another way to link to a FOAF file from my RSS \nfeed. It looks easier than previous suggestions, and it has the advantage of \nbeing able to use it from an RSS 1.0 or 2.0 feed, but I worry about all these \nvariations. Just as in real life, where people can use different words that \nmean essentially the same thing, in the Semantic Web programs can use different \nvocabularies to express the same statements. That's great for producers, not so \ngreat for consumers who have to make sense of it all. \nFor each domain (RSS feeds, FOAF files, whatever), somebody (or some group) \nneeds to come along and document best practices. We need better _goal-oriented_ \ndocumentation. We have a lot of reference documentation, task-oriented \ndocumentation, but very little that documents that larger picture and answers \nquestions written in English. &#8220;How do I include personal information in \nmy RSS feed?&#8221; is a goal-oriented question. &#8220;Create a FOAF file \nusing this tool and then insert this line at this location in your RSS \nfeed&#8221; (with as many examples as necessary) is a goal-oriented answer. \nAnything less is like trying to master a foreign language by reading a \ndictionary.\n[1] \n",
