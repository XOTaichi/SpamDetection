    "body": "\nA New Theory on Mapping the New World\nBy Guy Gugliotta\nWashington Post Staff Writer\nMonday, October 7, 2002; Page A07\nIn 1507, a group of scholars working in France produced an extraordinary map\nof the world, the first to put the still-recent discoveries of Columbus and\nothers into a new continent separate from Asia, and to call that continent\n\"America.\" With the Waldseemuller map, the New World was born.\nBut there was something else. What would later come to be called South\nAmerica and Central America were surprisingly well-shaped, not only on the\neast coast, where explorers had already sailed, but also on the west coast\n-- which no European was known to have seen.\nThe ice cream cone bulge that sticks out into the Pacific at the junction of\nmodern-day Chile and Peru is readily visible and in almost exactly the right\ngeographical spot -- not only in the main map, but also in an inset printed\nalong its top.\nThe shape of South America in the main map appears distorted because of the\ncurvature of the Earth.\nIt is an improbable coincidence, if it was a coincidence, for the map -- 12\nlarge printed pages to be arrayed in one 36-square-foot wall display -- was\npublished six years before Vasco Balboa's 1513 trip across the Isthmus of\nPanama and 12 years before Ferdinand Magellan's 1519-22 trip around the\nworld.\nDid someone get there earlier?\n...\n------------------------ Yahoo!
