Type a few\n | characters of the folder name and hit space for autocomplete.\nThis works, but is not nice if you're not using the keyboard, but just\nthe mouse.\nTony: I agree - a nice way to link in one click would be good, and should\nbe easy to add, though currently adding mouse bindings (something like\nshift right click would be a good choice) is much harder than adding\nkey bindings.\nBut note there's no need to \"undo\" - the way I generally use link, if\nthe desired destination folder isn't the current selected target, is\nto right click on the target, which selects it and moves the message,\n(and because I have the \"automatic move to the next message on move or\nlink option set) select the message again, and then \"Link\".\nExmh only permits one uncomitted action to be selected for a message at a\ntime, that is, one of delete, move, or link. Selecting any of those\nimplicitly undoes any previous choice from the three (so you cannot\nachieve a \"move\" by doing a link, then delete, then commit, it needs to\nbe link, commit, delete, commit). (xmh was just the same there incidentally).\n | How's spring shaping up \"down under\"?\nNo meaningful comment from me, I'm not there at the minute. But I'm told\nthat where I'm from it is cold, wet, and miserable, though has been better\nduring the day (sunny days, cold nights) for the past few. In any case,\nall of that is a good enough reason to stay away...\nkre\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-users mailing list\nExmh-users@redhat.com\n",
