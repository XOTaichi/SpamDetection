This will likely require] a prolonged bombing campaign targeting major \n U.S. cities and military installations, followed by a ground invasion led \n by European forces. \"Civilian casualties would likely be substantial,\" said \n a French military analyst. \"But the American people must be liberated from \n tyranny.\" \n [...] \"Even before Bush, the American political system was a shambles,\" \n said Prof. Salvatore Deluna of the University of Madrid. \"Their \n single-party plutocracy will have to be reshaped into true \n parliamentary-style democracy. Moreover, the economy will have to be \n retooled from its current military dictatorship model--in which a third of \n the federal budget goes to arms, and taxes are paid almost exclusively by \n the working class--to one in which basic human needs such as education and \n poverty are addressed. Their infrastructure is a mess; they don't even have \n a national passenger train system. Fixing a failed state of this size will \n require many years.\"\n \nWelcome news. The only way to crush America's fundamentalist tendencies is by \nshowing them who's boss.\n[1] \n",
