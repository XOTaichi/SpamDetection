    "body": "I am trying to manage the email for a domain which I have hosted with\nhosting365, and am trying to get the whole email send and receive thing\nworking nice and easily.\nAt the moment I have configured Fetchmail to poll the different pop3\nmailboxes and deliver the mail accordingly, although it appears that I have\nto have only one unix user being able to receive from each pop3 mailbox.\nThis could be a limitation of the fetchmailconf programme, I'm not sure, but\nIt would be much handier if I could just tell it to collect all of the mail\nfrom the different mailboxes, and then deliver it locally according to the\n\"To:\" header instead of the pop3 mailbox it came from.\nThe other issue I am having is sending outgoing mail. I have been trying to\nuse sendmail, but am finding it to be an absolute pain in the posterior, and\nwhen the relay server will only accept outgoing connections if I have\nchecked for incoming mail in the last twenty minutes, and I don't know how\nto set sendmail to run a command before it sends out the mail. Do any of\nthe outgoing mailer programs, exim or postfix or whatever, have a 'nice'\nconfiguration interface, or do they all have nice friendly configuration\nfiles like sendmail.\nAny suggestions of alternative solutions would be much appreciated. There\nare only three or four email addresses in my domain, and setting it up for\nscheduled collection and either scheduled or immediate delivery would do me\nfine.\nThanks,\n\tDavid.\nDavid Hamilton\nSenior Technical Consultant\nHP Ireland \n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\n for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n",
