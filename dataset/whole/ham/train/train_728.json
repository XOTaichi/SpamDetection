    "body": "URL: \nDate: Not supplied\nEddie Kessler describes programming at Napster[1]. \nRay Ozzie has more on platforms[2]. \"Finding the 'right' price point for a \nsoftware platform is critical.\" To me this sounds like a fancy way of saying, \n\"I groove all that stuff about how platforms need to be cheap and ubiquitous, \nbut I can't bring myself to do it.\" The price, Ray says, \"must be high enough \nboth 1) to maintain a perception of value in the platform, and 2) to create \nsignificant margins well before ubiquity is assured so that the ecosystem is \nassured of the platform's ultimate viability.\" What he doesn't mention: if you \nlower the price on the only product you're selling, you have a revenue hit, \nwhich will not make your investors happy, and you may run out of money and have \nto close. But that must be what he's thinking.\n[1] \n[2] \n",
