    "body": "\n> You have multiple generations of\n> peasants/squatters that cultivate and live on the lands almost as a\n> human parts of the property package.\nWhen I'd read that \"getting legal title\ncan take 20 years\", when I believe that\n1 year ought to be more than sufficient,\n(and helped by the Cairo reference) I'd\nassumed that we were talking about the\nurban poor.\nIf I see people living in mansions, or\neven in suburban subdivisions, I assume\nthey didn't have too much trouble with\ntheir titles.\nIf I see people living in shanties and\nhaphazard alleyways, I tend to assume\ntheir parcels weren't exactly recorded\non the government maps, or paid for with\na bank loan, especially when nearby vacant\nlots have shotgun wielding men presumably\nintent on keeping them \"development\" free.\nNow, it may be that \"Manhattanites' view\nof America\" to say that outside of Metro\nManila, Davao, and maybe another city or\ntwo (Cebu?), everything else (literally)\nis the boondocks. But going on that very\nbroad assumption, I guess I'm describing\nthe flip side of Mr. Roger's experience:\nthe paisanos (who leave behind those who\nremain on a patron's rural land) move to\nManila, and (the second assumption) squat\nin shantytowns there, at least until they\ncan line up a middle-class job.\nSo, going on two large assumptions, I can\ncome up with a scenario under which title\nwould take 20 years: a shantytown arises\nsomewhere in the midst of a section (or\nwhatever the Spanish used to divvy up the\nland) and it takes decades of arguing to\nput together a package which somehow can\nboth compensate the owner and record lots\nfor the inhabitants. Just transferring\ntitle to an existing lot, between parties\nwho have money, ought not to be a problem.\nThe obvious solution, at least to us\nbarking farting chihuahuas on FoRK, is\nto \"introduce market mechanisms\". It is\nleft as an exercise to come up with one\nwhich works when many of the agents (are\nperceived to) have negligible NPV.\n-Dave\n> [land reform] meant that all the agricultural producers had\n> to plant crops all the time (profitable or not) ...\nWhat happened to more highly-capitalized\nland? Putting in trees instead of crops\nsounds like it might sidestep that.\n> Mr. Long, I think you'd particularly enjoy the De Soto work.\nOn the \"to find\" list. Any chance of\nan explanation of that \"Bell Jar\" in\nthe meantime?\n",
