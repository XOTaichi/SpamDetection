There's a far better example: The New York Times. \nIncredibly, this institution puts out pages and pages of high-quality \nprofessional content each week and then distributes them by means of men in \ntrucks across the country overnight where they sit, waiting to be sold to \npeople. Meanwhile, the exact same content is available _for free_ using an \ninsidious peer-to-peer downloading system called \"the Web\" by typing in the \nkeyword \"\". Those people at the New York Times must not \nunderstand the Internet or something! \nMore examples: the thriving shareware market, the Baen Free Library, Janis Ian \nand others. \nOther times, people claim that no one will create if they can't get paid. I'd \nlike to introduce you to free software and just about every weblog on the \nplanet.\n",
