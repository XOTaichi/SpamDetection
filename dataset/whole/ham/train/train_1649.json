The strength to weight ratio of a spider is so high\n E> that Spiderman is able to throw a bus several city blocks with\n E> little effort. His endurance is similarly enhanced as well.\nCould this be as simple as a modified molecular structure where the\nhumanoid cells are in fact exo-skeletally structured with more atoms\nper cubic angstrom to achieve the distance-squared tensile strength\nenhancements we find when we introduce smaller metal atoms between the\nlattice packed grid of iron atoms to create steel? \nThis 'steel-effect' might give bone structure and tendons dramatically\n(several orders of magnitude) more tensile strength without the need\nto significantly increase the weight (like magnesium-alloy or\ncarbon-fiber weight compared to iron, Spidey could even be way under\nweight). Only increasing tensile strength could accommodate the\nmobility and leverage feats since bones are actually formed from\nbubbles of organic material hydrolically assisted, tensile strength\ncross-sectionally would give his frame the strength to withstand the\nmuscular enhancement.\n E> As for the spidey senses, well they're really great, but AFAIK\n E> not really well explained in the comic series. \nIf the same close-packing gap-filling arachne-molecular structure\nmodification occurs in neural tissues, and there'd be no reason to\nthink that these would grow differently from bones and tendons, then\nwhat we are seeing in spidey sense is no more than the heightened\ncerebral functions due to shorter/faster/stronger synapses throughout\nthe entire nervous system. \nSince we know dogs and cats measure human emotions by smell, clearly\nhearing the heartbeats, and other subtle clues within their normal\nsensory ranges (but seem mystical to us) ... for Peter Parker,\neverything from air currents on his facial-hairs to extremely subtle\nhormone smells might coallesce into a general gestalt of Spidey-Sense;\ndon't forget that he'd acquired this ability in adolescence and thus\nwould lack any cultural or even pathological basis to explain the\nheightened awareness to himself in anything but mystical terms. We\nknow from issue #1 that his collision-avoidance reflex response time\nwas far swifter than his cognitive awareness since he 'found' himself\nalready stuck to the tree when the bicycle was already past and hence\nhis disorientation (\"You ok, Mister?\") as if it was a hallucination.\nHmmm ... it may even be physio-psychologically interesting to examine\nif Peter Parker's personal quandries arose _because_ his physiological\n'Spidey' infrastructure had been advanced whereas his psychological\nperception of his self had not, ie, \"Peter\" was not \"Spiderman\" but\njust the \"driver of the bus\". Only, unlike ourselves, he found his\nself driving a body-vehicle not evolutionarily matched to his\ncognitive time-scales.\n-- \nGary Lawrence Murphy <garym@teledyn.com> TeleDynamics Communications Inc\n Business Advantage through Community Software : \n\"Computers are useless.
