    "body": "> I am facing the fact that exmh has been left behind in some industry\n> standards. I use it for my personal mail.

And mime handling is pretty bad\n> compared with modern mailers.\nThese are some good comments and I'd like to share an opinion here. (Is that permitted? :)\nI started using linux about 8 or 9 years ago in rebellion against what the university was doing with Winder$. I just couldn't get good support and was using a lot of unix-based tools (ported to Winder$) anyway. So, I jumped ship and became my own sysadm.\nWhat I got was the easy ability to use a shell (now ssh) to connect to my office box from just about anywhere and use either exmh or nmh (from the command line). I can do email for the office fairly easily.\nI haven't seen any other tools that let me do that yet. But, I have to admit, that some of the web-based mail software is getting pretty close. Quoting and such is still primitive, but they're moving forward.\n-=d\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-users mailing list\nExmh-users@redhat.com\n",
