    "body": "> \"the historical record\", by which you mean *human* historical record, is\n> highly overrated (nigh worthless) when you are talking about geological\n> timescales, even on topics with as short a timescale as climate.\nThere has been a significant recent increase in global CO2 concentrations.\nThe vast preponderance of the new CO2 in the atmosphere is due to human\nactivity starting around the industrialization of Europe, and accelerating\nafter WWII. Most scientists studying global climate change believe that\nthese increased CO2 concentrations are the primary causal agent for\nincreased global warming. Hence our interest in items of human time scale.\n> It is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers deposited\n> during the last major ice age, they are finding substantial evidence of\n> humans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glaciers\n> paved over their civilization. The receding glaciers have turned into a\n> bit of an archaeological treasure chest, as they expose artifacts buried\n> in and underneath them as they shrink that have been preserved by the\n> ice for thousands of years. I don't see any compelling reason to \"save\n> the glaciers\" anyway, particularly in light of the fact that their\n> existence has always been transient.\nMost global climate change scientists would agree that temperatures in the\npast have often been much warmer than today. The point of global warming\nisn't to save the Earth -- the planet is not sentient. The point is to\nunderstand and potentially reduce the impact of increasing temperatures on\nglobal human activity.\n> For anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations are\n> anthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another. I'll\n> just stick with Occam's Razor for now.\nThe increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration is due to human activity.\nIt is generally accepted that increases in CO2 in a closed environment\nsubject to solar heating retain more of that solar energy. This is the\ncurrent best explanation for the high temperature of Venus. If the CO2\nconcentration goes up globally (which it has), then theory states the earth\nshould be retaining greater solar energy. This process may be slow, and may\nbe difficult to monitor due to the variability of temperatures worldwide. I\nencourage you to refute any part of this causal chain linking CO2 to\neventual increases in global energy content, part of which will be evident\nas heat.\n- Jim\n",
