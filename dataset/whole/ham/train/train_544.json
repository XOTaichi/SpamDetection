    "body": "URL: \nDate: Not supplied\nThe T-Mobile Sidekick -- the first commercial implementation of the wonderful \nDanger Hiptop PDA/phone -- is now onsale and the reviews are starting to \nappear. As soon as I'm in San Francisco for more than a couple days straight, I \nreally think I'm going to pick this up. \n That's partly because it costs less than half as much as its current \n competitors -- $199, compared with $450 and up for the others. In the same \n spirit, T-Mobile will offer unlimited data usage on its new, relatively \n high- speed \"GPRS\" network for $40 per month -- far below what a serious \n surfer would likely rack up under competing wireless-data plans. (Voice \n time is another story -- more on that later.) \n Another reason I like the Sidekick's prospects: It was designed for, and \n will be pitched to, a very different market. While vendors of the competing \n hybrids focus on \"enterprise\" customers -- the big businesses that are \n supposed to have deep pockets for this sort of thing (even though most \n clearly don't at this point) -- Danger and T-Mobile are targeting, in their \n own words, \"Internet-savvy, primarily urban, young adults in the 18- to \n 34-year-old demographic.\" \nI am that demographic!
