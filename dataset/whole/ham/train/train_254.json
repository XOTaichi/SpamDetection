    "body": "URL: \nDate: 2002-10-03T01:31:51-05:00\nRemember that saying from chaos theory about how when a butterfly flap its \nwings, it can cause a hurricane a month later halfway around the world? As \nseveral people have already noted, Google has made some major changes in their \nmost recent update. The weblogging community was hit hard (for instance, I used \nto be the #1 \"mark\"[1]; I am now #6). The changes appear to be the result of an \nattempt to stop two phenomena: explicitly selling ads based on PageRank[2], and \nGoogle bombing[3]. \nSpecifically, Google is now apparently cross-checking link text with the linked \nsite, and discounting or ignoring links whose text does not appear in the \nlinked site. This all but kills off Google bombing. Searching for \"go to hell\"\n[4] no longer takes you to microsoft.com[5]; searching for \"talentless hack\"[6] \nno longer finds ohmessylife.com[7], although it finds a lot of people who were \npreviously participating in the Google bombing. No definitive word yet on \nwhether Google is actively penalizing such sites. \nUnfortunately, the algorithm tweaks necessary to stop these two techniques have \ncaused a wide range of collateral damage, apparently coming down hardest on \nmedium-to-large sites that had previously been doing everything right (as far \nas page structure, link structure, accessibility, and general honest hard work \nputting together a usable and useful site). The Webmasterworld forums are alive \nwith complaints and speculation: \n- New update, pagerank death?[8] \n- September 2002 Google Update Discussion - part 1[9] \n- Let's find out what happened - Sept 2002 Update - pt. 2[10] \n(Side note: amongst the confusion, it has been suggested that Google is no \nlonger indexing ALT text in images. I can confirm that this is absolutely \nfalse. Searching diveintomark.org for \"gimli\"[11] finds my entry of July 29[12]\n, where \"Gimli\" is mentioned only in the ALT text of an image.) \nRegardless, Google's search results in general appear to be significantly \ndegraded in many key areas. The forums are full of people complaining that spam \nsites, doorway pages, and obvious cloaking attempts, which Google used to be so \ngood at filtering out, are now popping up in top spots with disturbing \nfrequency. Nobody in the forums wants to talk about which keywords they're \ntracking, so I tried to find my own concrete example of crap search results. It \ndidn't take long. \n- Searching for reservation hotel[13] brings up an empty sub-page[14] of a \nhotel reservation company in Italy[15] as the first result. This seems \nunhelpful, and unlikely to be relevant to the average US-based consumer (and \nGoogle absolutely knows I'm in the US based on my IP address). \n- Searching for news observer nc[16] (the News & Observer is a Raleigh, NC \nnewspaper) does find The News & Observer[17], but it also finds an Internet \nbetting spam page[18] at #7 and a non-existent page[19] at #9. \n- Searching for eminem[20] gives us two generic portal pages, a non-existent \nsite, and a site that redirects to a site that continuously redirects to itself \n(I am not making this up). And this is just on the first page. Good thing I \ndidn't care that much about Eminem to begin with, because Google just isn't \nthat helpful. \nMany people in the Webmasterworld forums are now suggesting that AllTheWeb.com\n[21] has better search results overall. Just as a single comparison, their \nresults for \"eminem\"[22] do appear to be much more relevant. Is this the \nbeginning of the end of Google's reign?\n[1] \n[2] \n[3] \n[4] \n[5] \n[6] \n[7] \n[8] \n[9] \n[10] \n[11] \n[12] \n[13] \n[14] \n[15] \n[16] \n[17] \n[18] \n[19] \n[20] \n[21] \n[22] search?query=eminem\n",
