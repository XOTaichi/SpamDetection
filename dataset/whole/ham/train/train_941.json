As \nmany of you may have found out or guessed, I will be attending oral argument \nfor the Eldred case[2] before the Supreme Court. \nI'm incredibly excited, as you might imagine. Visiting the Supreme Court would \nbe quite enough, but seeing such an important case...Dayenu! When Lessig asked \nme if I was free that day to come, I laughed because I couldn't (and still \ncan't) think of anything I'd rather do than attend. I am eternally grateful to \nLessig for the chance to attend. On the other hand, I'm sort of embarassed to \nhave the opportunity, when there are surely others who deserve it far more than \nme. Luckily, it seems that such deserving others will be able to get seats by \ncamping in line with us. \nSo, I'll be arriving in D.C. on Tuesday, attending an \nEldred/Duke/EPIC/Bookmobile superparty, and then camping in line with Seth \nSchoen[3], Lisa Rein, Jace Cooke but unfortunately not Cory Doctorow. If you'd \nlike to come with us, let me know. \nI was hoping I'd be able to take notes and post them to my weblog for those who \ncouldn't make it, but as I read in today's Times, only lawyers and those with \nofficial press credentials are allowed to take notes![4] I think this is \noutrageous, but hopefully I will be able to remember enough to provide an \ninteresting account. \nIn a related irony, today was \"Disney Day\" at Borders[5], where they played \nDisney rock songs with the volume turned up too loud, disturbing my usual habit \nof reading a book there. However, I did manage to skim through _The Practice of \nProgramming_. \nIn an unrelated note, if you haven't been electrocuted by a Model T spark plug, \nI highly recommend it.\n[1] \n[2] \n[3] \n[4] \n[5] \n",
