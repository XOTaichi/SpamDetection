    "body": "Ananova:Â  \nNewspaper's readers complain over 'let's have sex' picture caption\nReaders of an African newspaper have complained after a picture caption\nabout jewellery contained the words \"let's have sex\".\nThe mix-up highlights the problems caused by the wide range of languages\nspoken in Namibia.\nCallers to the Namibian were angered by the use of the word tulumweni, which\ntranslates roughly as \"let's have intercourse\" in the Oshiwambo language.\nIt was used in a caption concerning people in the Caprivi who use rings from\nthe femidon - female condom - as jewellery.\nAccording to the The Namibian , an activist involved in care for Aids/HIV\npatients spelt the word tulumweni for the journalist.\nHe intended it to mean \"you will see for yourselves\" in the Siyeyi tongue.\nOne caller said the complainants \"should be considerate of other people's\nlanguages. It is very clear that the picture was taken in the Caprivi ...And\nthat the word is from Siyeyi. It is not Oshiwambo\".\nOthers indicated that various words might have different meanings in various\nNamibian languages, such as omakende, an Oshiwambo word for glasses which in\nSiyeyi means testicles.\nAnother word with a double-meaning is tulikunde, which in Oshiwambo\ntranslates as let's talk, but which in Sisubiya translates as let's have\nintercourse.\nThe Herero word for a hat is ekoli, which is an Oshiwambo word for a vagina.\nStory filed: 12:37 Tuesday 8th October 2002\n------------------------ Yahoo!
