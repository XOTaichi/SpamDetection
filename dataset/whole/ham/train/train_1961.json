I get to see bad CDROM problems all the time.

No\nend_of_the_world problems, and easily fixed.\n> I guess I'll settle for the /dev/dvd link change as described and putting\n> the DMA tip in the %description :-)\nMy biggest beef with automatically setting /dev/dvd is that I always\nseem to have a CD-Burner and a DVD drive (or DVD burner) in the same\nbox, and I usually have the DVD as the second drive /dev/cdrom1 in\n\"kudzu-speak\". I agree that the %description is the best place for the\ntip. Unless someone can come up with a way to probe CD/DVD drives to\ndivulge their largest supported media size without loading ide-scsi or\nhaving that media currently in the drive.\n-- \nChris Kloiber\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\n",
