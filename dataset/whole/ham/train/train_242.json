This is remarkable for its lack of\nnewsworthiness.\n1) Bletchley Park used optical sensors, which were (and\nstill are) the best way to read paper tape at high speed.\nYou can read about it in the standard accounts, e.g.\n \n2) For decades before that, codebreakers were using optical\ncomputing in the form of superposed masks to find patterns.\nYou can read about it in Kahn.\n3) People have been doing opto-electronic computing for\ndecades. There's a lot more to it than just holography.\nI get 14,000 hits from\n \n> Optical info is a complex-valued wave (spatial frequency, amplitude and\n> phase)\nIt isn't right to make it sound like three numbers (frequency,\namplitude, and phase); actually there are innumerable\nfrequencies, each of which has its own amplitude and phase.\n> lenses, refractions, and interference are the computational operators.\n> (add, copy, multiply, fft, correlation, convolution) of 1D and 2D arrays\n>\n> and, of course, massively parallel by default.\n>\n> and, of course, allows free-space interconnects.\nSome things that are hard with wires are easy with\nlight-waves. But most things that are easy with wires\nare hard with light-waves.\n> Here's a commercialized effort from israel: a \"space integrating\n> vector-matric multiplier\" [ A ] B = [ C ]\n> laser-> 512-gate modulator -> spread over 2D\n> \"256 Teraflop equivalent\" for one multiply per nanosecond.\nPeople were doing smaller versions of that in\nthe 1980s.\n> Unclassified example: acousto-optic spectrometer, 500 Gflops equivalent\n> (for 12 watts!) doing continuous FFTs.

It's undergrad\nphysics-lab stuff. I get 6,000 hits from:\n \n> Of course, the rest of the talk is about the promise of moving from\n> optoelectronic to all-optical processors (on all-optical nets & with\n> optical encryption, & so on).\nAll optical??? No optoelectronics anywhere???\nThat's medicinal-grade pure snake oil, USP.\nPhotons are well known for not interacting with\neach other. It's hard to do computing without\ninteractions.\n--- end forwarded text\n-- \n-----------------\nR. A.
