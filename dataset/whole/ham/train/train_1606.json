    "body": "URL: \nDate: Not supplied\nDisney's put up a little brochureware site about its forthcoming (and very \nexciting!) film based on the Haunted Mansion ride, a followup to the Country \nBears movie (I may be the only adult in the world who enjoyed that one). All \nthat's there now is a downlaodable poster, which is pretty keen, except for \nthis supercillious bit of legal crapola you have to click through to get at it. \n [IMG: Disney Pictures hereby \n grants you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, one-year royalty free \n license to use and display the Images on your site in accordance with the \n terms below. Nothing herein by implication or otherwise, shall grant you \n any rights other than as explicitly set forth below. \n You shall receive HTML code and GIF file (the \"Files\") from Disney Pictures \n to incorporate the Images into your site. You agree not to modify the Files \n in any way. Acceptance and use of the Files indicates acceptance of these \n terms of use. If you do not accept these terms of use, you must not use or \n display the Files.
