The golden rule of the internet: when you find a free resource, don't piss'em off! :) I really appreciate your work; you get done the things I wish I could, and I respect that.\n> Anyway, although I'd easily recommend upgrading 7.x to 7.3 using apt, I\n> wouldn't for 7.x to 8.0 as they are C++ binary incompatible... and apt is\n> entirely written in C++ and dynamically linked :-/\n OK, I'll search for the ISOs on the one remaining site that isn't hammered. :)\n \n> Still, that doesn't explain a core dump :-(\n Sure: this is a linking issue, right? Right now I'm still pure-vanilla. I have the stock version of rpm/rpmlib/popt/etc and the recommended version of apt that you gave me. No, wait...there's no new code getting loaded.
