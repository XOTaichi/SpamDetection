As Michael \npointed out, there's something of an arms-race between manufacturers and \nattackers which has nothing to do with clock rate, and time and time again \nwhat we've seen is that it's not a question of \"is it secure\", it's a \nquestion of \"who is it secure from and for how long?\" Security is rarely a \nquestion of absolutes (despite the often boolean nature of a break), rather \nit's a question of assessing, quantifying, and managing risk. SmartCards are \ndesigned to address threats in which the cost of protection cannot exceed the \n$1-20 range (depending on the application).\nAs whether or not they are \"trusted hardware\", the question again revolves \naround attacker and timeframe. One might expect a bored undergrad EE student \nto have more trouble revealing the contents of a pilfered smartcard than, \nsay, a governtment intelligence service. If your goal is to keep undergrad \nEEs from perpetrating mass fraud in the caffeteria, then a smartcard is \nlikely \"trustworthy\" enough for your application. If your aim is to protect \nICBM launch codes, then it's probably the wrong tool. In either application, \na risk/cost ratio must justify the use of the protection measure in question.\n-- \nAlex Russell\nalex@SecurePipe.com\nalex@netWindows.org\n",
