The\ntraction is the limiting factor, not motor power. You can basically put\nthe motors into wheelhubs mounted on a composite frame, and dump juice\ninto them until they melt, which will be some 100 sec downstream. Plenty\nof time to smoke anything.\nOf course, it doesn't roar, and spew smokage, so it won't happen.\n",
