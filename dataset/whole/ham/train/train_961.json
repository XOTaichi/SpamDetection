Make yourself sexier.\nAt least that's the solution proposed by an Italian mayor -- and a woman\nmayor at that.\nWives in the northern town of Missaglia had complained to mayor Marta\nCasiraghi about a young woman who sunbathed topless on her terrace.\nThey complained that the men in the town of some 7,000 people were spending\ntoo much time ogling, so they asked Casiraghi to order the woman to put her\nclothes back on.\nBut the mayor, far from sympathizing, told the wives to get sexy if they\nwanted to keep their men. \"The girl was very pretty and was soaking up some\nsun. Topless sunbathing is largely tolerated and widespread nowadays.\nThere's nothing we can do,\" Casiraghi told Il Nuovo, a web-based newspaper.\n\"Instead, I'd advise the wives to play their rival at her own game -- make\nthemselves more beautiful.\"\n",
