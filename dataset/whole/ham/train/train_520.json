    "body": "If you need to store a database password, then\nclearly the first step is to store the text outside the\nweb tree. You can encrypt it and store the encryption key elsewhere,\nso that at least an attacker has to get two different things.\nAlso, don't get full privileges - create a user account that\nis GRANTed very limited access.\nHowever, you can often do better than this if security\nis critical. Create a separate program which has these\ndatabase keys (as noted above), and make the web program\ncontact IT. Create a very limited protocol that ONLY\nlets you do the operations you need (you can add specific\noperations later). There's a performance hit, which you're\ntrading for improved data isolation.\nGiorgio Zoppi wrote:\n> On Fri, Aug 23, 2002, David Wheeler wrote:\n> \n> \n>>The standard way to store passwords is... not to\n>>store passwords.
