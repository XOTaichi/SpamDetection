It takes a few seconds for all\n> of the folders in the fcache to turn blue. \nThis is true...it's now looking at more than just unseen, so it takes a little \nwhile (in the background) to build the sequences window. There is probably \nsome tuning possible in this area.\n> In +inbox, I have 4 unread messages. They aren't blue, they are\n> white background with a normal colored font.\nI changed the default display of unseen messages from a foreground of blue to \na background of white to make it possible to see what other sequences unseen \nmessages may be in. I *did* ask Brent before I did it. If you like the old \nbehavior, the old lines are still in app-defaults-color, but commented out.\n> If I click on a message, I get the following traceback:\n> \n> invalid command name \"Mh_MarkSeen\"\n> while executing\n> \"Mh_MarkSeen $exmh(folder) $msgid\"\n> (procedure \"Hook_MsgShow_update_unseen\" line 5)\n> invoked from within\n> \"$cmd $mhProfile(path)/$exmh(folder)/$msgid mimeHdr\"\n> (procedure \"MsgShow\" line 23)\n> invoked from within\n> \"MsgShow $msgid\"\n> (procedure \"MsgChange\" line 18)\n> invoked from within\n> \"MsgChange 66 show\"\n> invoked from within\n> \"time [list MsgChange $msgid $show\"\n> (procedure \"Msg_Change\" line 3)\n> invoked from within\n> \"Msg_Change $msgNum $show\"\n> (procedure \"Msg_Pick\" line 8)\n> invoked from within\n> \"Msg_Pick $lineno show\"\n> (procedure \"FtocRangeEnd\" line 12)\n> invoked from within\n> \"FtocRangeEnd [lindex [split [.ftoc.t index current] .] 0] 0\"\n> (command bound to event)\nThis is because of your Hook_MsgShow_update_unseen which is calling a function \nwhich no longer exists.\nI suspect you need\n\tSeq_Del $exmh(folder) unseen $msgid\nnow instead of \n\tMh_MarkSeen $exmh(folder) $msgid\n> It appears that the message does get marked as seen though, as it\n> loses the white background, and nmh reports the same. \n> \n> If I click the flist button, it zero's the unseen count, and then\n> there is again a visible delay as it counts up all the unseen \n> messages - maybe 3-4 seconds.\n> \n> I really think my installation is OK now, but if this behavior is just\n> really strange I'll blow everything away and reinstall.
