The Blog would be Sherman from \n \"Peabody's Improbable History\" -- a traveler of time and space in search of \n beauty, truth, and the outre. I think Jethro bOING bOING and Sherman Boing \n Boing would be great pals. Jethro would invite Sherman's dog, Mr. Peabody, \n to go raccoon hunting with him, and Sherman would send Jethro 40 years into \n the future to hang out at the Playboy Mansion. \nLink[1] Discuss[2]\n[1] \n[2] \n",
