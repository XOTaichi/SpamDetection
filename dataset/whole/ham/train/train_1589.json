Images are overlayed on the topological data to help people\nnavigate familiar terrain visually. In other words, it is not intended as a\nwannabe spy satellite. Rather it is a very accurate three dimensional model\nof the earth's surface. When a particular region in question is covered in\na city, the buildings in the city are mapped as though they are part of the\nearth's surface. The part that makes the app killer is that you can map all\nsorts of data layers on top of their core topological data.\nGot it?\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n",
