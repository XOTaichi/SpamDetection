    "body": "Hindus mourn 'monkey god'\nBy Omer Farooq\nBBC reporter in Hyderabad\nHundreds of people have attended the funeral of a monkey which became\nrevered as a divine incarnation of a Hindu god in the southern Indian\nstate of Andhra Pradesh.\nThe monkey was quite old and both its hind legs were paralysed\nAnimal rights campaigners say the monkey died of starvation and exhaustion\nafter being trapped in a temple for a month by over-zealous worshippers.\nThe animal was cremated in Anantapur district, 400 kilometres (250 miles)\nsouth of the state capital, Hyderabad, on Sunday.\nIt had not eaten for three weeks.\nLast rites were performed by priests in the village of Timmiganipally in\nthe presence of hundreds of devotees who had come to believe that the\nmonkey was a reincarnation of the Hindu monkey god, Hanuman.\nGarlanded\nOne animal rights activist said his group's efforts to save the monkey had\nfailed because of the blind faith of the people.\nThe monkey's death came a day after he and others tried to move the animal\nout of the temple, but were prevented by villagers.\nThe monkey, which was found perched on top of an idol of Hanuman a month\nago, attracted hundreds of devotees every day from surrounding villages,\nas well as from the neighbouring state of Karnataka.\nDevotees showered the monkey with fruit and flowers and worshipped it\naround the clock.\n'Exploited'\nLocals said they believed that Lord Hanuman was visiting the village, as\nthe temple had stopped daily rituals after a dispute between two groups of\nresidents.\nBut animal rights campaigners complained that the animal was being\nmistreated.\nThey filed a petition in the state's High Court saying the monkey had been\nforcibly confined in the temple.\nThe group also alleged that people's religious feelings were being\nexploited to make money.\nThe court then ordered the local administration to rescue the monkey - but\nvillagers prevented officials from taking him for treatment in time.\n",
