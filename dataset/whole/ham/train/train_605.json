Normal terminal velocity is much slower.\nTerminal velocity can be calculated by $v_{T} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2mg}{CpA}}$\nwhere C is an experimentally determined coefficient, p is the density of the\nair, and A is the area of the object. These calculations only work if the\nobject is blunt and the airflow is turbulent, blah blah blah. Terminal velocity\nfor a skydiver actually varies with how the diver holds themselves -- you go\nfaster if you pull yourself into a cannonball. That is the \"A\", for the\nmost part. \nAll else being equal, the terminal velocity is inversely proportional to the\nsquare root of air density. Air density drops off pretty quickly, and I \nreally should be doing something other than digging up the math for that. I\nthink it involves calculus to integrate the amount of mass as the column of\nthe atmosphere trails off. I grabbed the other stuff directly out of a book :).\nIn '87 a guy named Gregory Robertson noticed a fellow parachutist Debbie \nWilliams had been knocked unconscious. He shifted so that he was head down,\nhit about 200 mi/h, and caught up with her and pulled her chute with 10 seconds\nto spare.\n-- \nnjl\n",
