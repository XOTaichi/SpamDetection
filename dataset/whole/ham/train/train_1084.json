If you\nvisit a samizdat site you can get in trouble. If you get samizdat spam,\nthe worst that can be said is that you might have read it. And as long as\nthe mailers send to individuals who clearly didn't opt-in, like party\nofficials, then other recipients can't get in trouble for requesting the\nmail. \nPlus, it's much harder to block spam than web sites.\nBut this shouldn't come as a surprize. Spam is speech. It may be sleazy, \nbut so what.\n- Lucas\n",
