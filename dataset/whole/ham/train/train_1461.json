    "body": "\nForwarded-by: William Knowles <wk@c4i.org>\nBy PAUL CROSBIE\nSep 16, 2002\nVIRGIN'S latest airliner is being revamped after randy passengers\ndiscovered a tiny cabin was just the place to join the Mile High Club.\nThe 130million Airbus 340-600 is fitted with a 5ft x 4ft mother and\nbaby room with a plastic table meant for changing nappies.\nBut couples keep wrecking it by sneaking in for a quick bonk.\nVirgin has replaced the table several times even though the plane only\ncame into service a few weeks ago.\nIt is named Claudia Nine after sexy model Claudia Schiffer, 32, who\nlaunched it in July.\nNow Virgin bosses have asked Airbus to build a stronger table.\nAt first, German engineers responsible for the jet's interior were\nbaffled by the problem.\nThe table is designed to take the weight of a mum and baby.\nOne Airbus worker said: \"We couldn't work it out. Then the penny\ndropped. It didn't occur to the Germans that this might happen. It\ncaused great amusement.\"\nThe firm say the cost of strengthening the tables will be about 200.\nA Virgin spokeswoman said: \"Those determined to join the Mile High\nClub will do so despite the lack of comforts.\n\"We don't mind couples having a good time but this is not something\nthat we would encourage because of air regulations.\"\nThe new Airbus is the world's longest airliner, with teasing slogan\n\"Mine is bigger than yours\". Virgin is using it on flights to the Far\nEast and the US.\n",
