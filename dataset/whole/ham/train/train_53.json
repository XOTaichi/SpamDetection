    "body": "URL: \nDate: Not supplied\nTeresa's written a wonderful blog post about the revelation that Tyco's crooked \nCEO spent \"6,000 on a shower curtain, $15,000 for an umbrella stand, $2,900 on \ncoat hangers, $5,960 on bedsheets and $2,200 for a wastebasket.\" \n Naturally, they assured her that not only is it possible to pay $6,000 for \n your shower curtains and $2,200 for a wastebasket, it's a Good Thing to do \n so, practically essential. Then they explain how: \n \"Sometimes the wastebasket is exposed,\" said Joel Joves, a designer with \n offices in Rancho Santa Fe and Beverly Hills. \"If you have a fabulous study \n or master bedroom, then maybe we need a pewter-finished basket with \n decorative pearl beadings or semiprecious stones to complete the look of a \n room.\" \n That's Fool Money at work. If you can't find a sufficiently fabulous \n wastebasket for $200, $500 absolute tops, you're not half trying. \nLink[1] Discuss[2]\n[1] \n[2] \n",
