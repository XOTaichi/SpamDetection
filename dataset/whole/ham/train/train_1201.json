    "body": "URL: \nDate: Not supplied\nI just finished reading an article about Mozilla[1] for Salon.com[2]. This \nexcerpt was rather amusing.\n_It is a good question, because in almost every way, Mozilla is a better \nbrowser than Navigator. For example, Netscape's best new feature, tabbed \nbrowsing -- which lets you have several Web pages open in the same browser \nwindow, and allows you to bookmark all the pages under one name -- was in \nMozilla many months ago, and the Mozilla project that created it (called \nMultiZilla) already has an improved version available. When asked about this, \nYecies, of Netscape, said, \"That's true, but the engineer who's working on it \n[for Mozilla] is a Netscape employee. It was always done with the intention of \nfostering general browsing usability for Netscape.\" \n_\nYes, ok, I suppose that's true if by \"Netscape employee\" you really meant \n\"Apple employee.\" and by \"always done with the intention of fostering general \nbrowsing usability for Netscape\" you meant \"was done in a weekend for Mozilla \nbecause I thought MultiZilla was cool.\" \nHere's how the whole tabbed browsing thing happened. One night I finally \ndownloaded an extension called MultiZilla (go check it out on mozdev.org[3]. I \nwas particularly impressed with a feature contained in MultiZilla called tabbed \nbrowsing. I started doing research and discovered NetCaptor[4], a tabbed \nbrowser that embedded WinIE. \nMultiZilla was cool but at the time suffered from two fundamental flaws that \nprevented the code from being incorporated into the Mozilla tree. The first was \na UI flaw, namely that at the time it had ripped off NetCaptor down to the last \ncontext menu item. The GUI was similar enough that there would have been \ndefinite concerns about so obviously copying some of NetCaptor's more obscure \ncapabilities (like sticky names and tab locking). The second concern was that \nthe tab behavior wasn't encapsulated cleanly into a widget. \nI produced a simplified version of tabbed browsing on my own time (did it in a \nweekend) that removed some of the geekier NetCaptor features and that \nencapsulated the tab behavior so that the changes to other Navigator files \nwould be minimal. Once I established that it didn't degrade performance in the \nsingle tab case, I checked it in as an experiment.\nThe response was overwhelming, as were the bugs that started being filed. So \nmuch so that at first I wanted to back tabbed browsing out of the tree. I was \noverruled by Mozilla, which turned out to be a good thing for all I think. :) \nEven with all the excitement and hoopla surrounding the advent of tabbed \nbrowsing on the engineering side (and in the Mozilla community), Netscape still \ndidn't get it. Netscape marketing prioritized all sorts of useless work that \nnobody had even started above tabbed browsing in their marketing document. They \ncontinued to do so for months, simply not getting it. It was this odd curiosity \nthat one of their engineers had checked in, and they didn't know what to make \nof it.\nOnly after the press raved about it did Netscape really jump on board. I'm sure \nNetscape is doing the same thing now with popup blocking. Can't you just see it \nnow? We'll have a Popup Manager, and a Manager to manage the Popup Manager, and \ntwenty-seven preferences for fine-grained control of all aspects of popups. \nCan you believe how disfunctional Netscape is? When their engineers say \"you \nshould do this\" or \"you should do that\", they get completely ignored (or blown \noff), but when CNet says \"We didn't like this, or we didn't like that.\", \nNetscape scurries to meet their demands. That is simply pathetic.\n[1] \n[2] \n[3] \n[4] \n",
