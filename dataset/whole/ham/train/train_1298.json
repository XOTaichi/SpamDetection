Or at least, I don't. I saw an advert for it on TV last\nnight (can't miss Futurama :-) and I thought, \"boy, that's dumb.\"\nIf I wanted to share pictures with someone, I'd email them to them,\nwhere they could see them on a 1024x or 1600x display, instead of\nrob\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Eugen Leitl [mailto:eugen@leitl.org]\nSent: Monday, August 19, 2002 1:34 AM\nTo: Rob Shavell\nCc: fork@example.com\nSubject: Re: sprint delivers the next big thing??\nOn Sun, 18 Aug 2002, Rob Shavell wrote:\n> down in the tech world than mobile visual communications.. and yet no one\n> seems to give much of a damn that right now that 2 persons can take photos\n> and share them instantly across space. this is one of the biggest - and\nThe word \"trivial\" comes to mind.\n> last - fundamental changes in human communications. will be as big as the\n> browser.\nRemote realtime streaming video is neat, but sharing pictures?
