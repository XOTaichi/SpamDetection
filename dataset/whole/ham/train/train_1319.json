    "body": "\nI apologize for not catching up to the current code in so long.\nNow that I have I'm trying to resolve \"breakage\" and differences.\nThe unseen window seems to have been replaced with the sequences \nwindow. While I appreciate the flexibility of the sequences \nwindow, the unseen window filled an important-to-me need: It \nwas tiny and could be set to show on all desktops of a virtual \nwindow manager without taking a lot of space. Since my normal \nmode of operation involves two copies of exmh displaying on a \n1024x768 vnc session, screen space is at a premium.\nAs things stand now, I have a sequences window that shows a lot\nmore information than I need to have handy and takes up a lot \nmore room than I can \"spare\".\nI can see that I could like the new sequences window a lot for \ncertain operations. But I'd like a nice uncluttered, tiny \nwindow that _only_ shows me info on my unread mail.\nOne possibility that occurs to me would be a button or mouse\nclick that \"shrinks\" the Sequences window to show only the\nsequences in the \"always show\" list. And of course a way to \nexpand it back.\n--Hal\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-workers mailing list\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\n",
