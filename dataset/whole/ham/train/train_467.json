    "body": "At Fermi (yes I'm back there; long story), we're buying 4U systems like \nthe fiscal year is ending. We have ~20 ASA IR4US1 systems (not pushing \nthem, there are some other similar units available), with 60 more on \norder. They're 2-1/2 TB for $10K, although we add a separate IDE or \nSCSI system disk, because the 3Ware RAID controllers can saturate. \nIntel SDS2 motherboard, 2 1.4GHz P3s, 2 GB ram, 2 3Ware 7850 Raid \ncontrollers, 16 160GB Maxtors, SysKonnect gigabit enet, Fermi RedHat 7.3.\nThere's some interesting info at:\nWe've decided to go with XFS (which Linus has just merged into the 2.5 \ntree), mostly because none of the other journaled fs's can maintain >30 \nGB/s rates with a nearly full filesystem (mostly GB files) with random \ndeletions (we use these systems for caching our 2 petabyte tape store). \n Ext3 almost did it but dropped from from ~38MB/s to 10 with random \ndeletions, and didn't want to do direct io at all. Only concern is an \noccasional system lock-up we haven't chased down yet. A load avg > 100 \nis always a patio of fun.\nOddly, even fairly beefy systems like these will breathe hard to keep up \nwith the new STK 9940B tape drives, which crank along at a steady \n30GB/s. And you oldforktimers will remember \"doofus\" my old file server \nsystem. It would only take 2.1\" of rackspace now, instead of 14 racks.\nCheers,\nWayne\n",
