Or even 300.\nEr, that study would seem to lend credence to Eugen's\nestimations, rather than casting fresh doubts. \n52 a year *does* exceed 300, in under 6 years' time. The average\nage of that study's participants was *39* -- meaning some \nparticipants may have had 20-25+ years of active sex life. \nAt that age, and further ** HIV+ **, it seems reasonable to\nthink that some the participants may have actually slowed \ntheir pace a bit. \nSo while this study's summary info is incomplete, you could \neasily conclude that the *average* participant in this one study\nwill have had over a thousand partners over a 40-50+ year active \nsex life, and so the even-more-active tails of the distribution\ncould easily be in the 3000+ range.\nOf course this says very little, almost nothing, about the overall \npopulation behavior, gay or straight, and the relative prevalence\nof 3K+ individuals in either group. But it does strongly suggest \nthat gay males with 3K+ partners exist in measurable numbers, so\npeople should stop treating Eugen's anecdotal estimation as if it\nwere sheer fantasy. BitBitch's own citation suggests otherwise.\n- Gordon\n",
