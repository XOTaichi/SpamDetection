The patch to have exmh do the right thing, whether this\nbug exists, or not, is trivial, so I'd suggest including it.\nPatch follows ...\nI have no idea why the sequences were being added after the message list\nbefore, not that it should make any difference to nmh (or MH). But since\nI stopped doing that, the variable \"msgs\" isn't really needed any more,\nrather than assigning $pick(msgs) to msgs, and then using $msgs the code\ncould just use $pick(msgs) where $msgs is now used. This is just a\nfrill though, so I didn't change that. \nkre\n--- pick.tcl\tFri Aug 23 16:28:14 2002\n+++ /usr/local/lib/exmh-2.5/pick.tcl\tSat Aug 24 18:14:44 2002\n@@ -128,7 +128,7 @@\n }\n proc Pick_It {} {\n global pick exmh\n- set cmd [list exec pick +$exmh(folder) -list]\n+ set cmd [list exec pick +$exmh(folder)]\n set inpane 0\n set hadpane 0\n for {set pane 1} {$pane <= $pick(panes)} {incr pane} {\n@@ -175,8 +175,9 @@\n }\n set msgs $pick(msgs)\n foreach s $pick(sequence) {\n-\tlappend msgs -sequence $s\n+\tlappend cmd -sequence $s\n }\n+ lappend cmd -list\n \n Exmh_Debug Pick_It $cmd $msgs\n busy PickInner $cmd $msgs\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-workers mailing list\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\n",
