    "body": "URL: \nDate: Not supplied\nThe WSJ has published a round-up of phone companies, wired and wireless, \nranking them based on performance and price. They don't mention Nextel, whose \nhullking milspec i700 handset I've been carrying for years now, with incredible \nreception all over the US and Canada. Their front-line customer service sucks, \nbut the prices and network can't be beat. \n T-Mobile is in the midst of a massive makeover. In recent months, the \n company changed its name and launched an ad campaign featuring Ms. Zeta \n Jones. \n The company has a history worth hiding. T-Mobile, a subsidiary of Deutsche \n Telekom, is known for having a weak national network, and the FCC received \n 1,466 complaints about the company in the past year, giving it one of the \n worst complaint rates in the industry. T-Mobile says their complaint rate \n has tapered off and that they have made substantial network improvements. \n But T-Mobile is the cheapest wireless provider, available, with an average \n cost of just 8.2 cents per minute. (Verizon, by contrast, costs 14.3 cents \n per minute.) \nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_via Camworld[3]_)\n[1] \n[2] \n[3] \n",
