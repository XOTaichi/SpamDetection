    "body": "The Times\n \n \n September 06, 2002\n \n Hitler-style applicant welcomed by parties\n By Roger Boyes\n \n \n \n MANAGERS of Germanys political parties are having difficulty explaining their\n enthusiastic reaction to a man who applied for membership with letters cribbed\n largely from Mein Kampf, Hitlers personal manifesto. The incident illustrates\n how indiscriminate parties have become in taking on new members during an\n election campaign, even when their sentiments bear a suspicious resemblance to\n those of the Führer. \n \n Edmund Stoiber is a thousand times more suited to leading Germany than the\n present Chancellor, said one letter sent to the Christian Social Union\n headquarters in Ingolstadt. Chancellor Schröder is doing nothing to stop the\n flood of foreigners who are spreading around our Fatherland, said the letter,\n signed by a certain Rudolph Lewald. \n \n The CSU immediately spotted a potential member. Many thanks for your nice\n thoughts, replied the local party manager, who enclosed an application for\n membership. \n \n The letter used chunks of Hitlers book, which is still banned in Germany.\n History students have to apply for access to the book in university libraries.\n \n \n The strongest, the brave and the hardworking will receive the birthright of\n existence, only those who are born weaklings could regard this as offensive,\n the letter-writer said. So-called humanity is melting like snow in the March\n sun. Such phrases were lifted from Mein Kampf, which was written while Hitler\n was in jail after the failed Munich putsch of 1923. \n \n Similar letters, also using the Nazi leaders words, were sent to the other\n political parties and drew sympathetic responses. I read your letter with\n great interest and pleasure, the manager of the Christian Democratic Union in\n Cologne, said. \n \n Great that you want to join us! enthused the Green Party headquarters. The\n Free Democrats invited the aspiring party member to a fundraising charity ball\n at which Hans- Dietrich Genscher, the former Foreign Minister, would be the\n star guest. The Social Democrats sent a list of rallies to be attended by\n Gerhard Schröder, the Chancellor. \n \n I wanted to test how serious parties are about combating right-wing\n extremism, said the letter-writer, who was in fact the Cologne novelist\n Rainer Popp. I had no idea that they would be so enthusiastic. \n \n For the first few days I expected two men in leather coats from the Special\n Branch to knock on my door. Instead only the postman called  with packets of\n election material from zealous political headquarters, Herr Popp said. \n \n I was stunned that political parties could react in this way  I reckon I\n would have had the same response if I had signed the letter Adolf Hitler.\n \n \n \n------------------------ Yahoo!
