And persistently getting in someones face is assault, a\ncriminal offense. If these people have something to say, they can say it\nwith signs or get their own venue. And here is something else to chew on...\nthese protesters are NOT interested in changing anyones mind about what\nRumsfield is saying. How likely are you to change someone's mind by being\nrude and disrespectful to them? Is this how to win friends and influence\npeople? Either these folks are social misfits who have no understanding of\nhuman interactions (else they would try more constructive means to get their\nmessage across) or they are just out to get their rocks off regardless of\nhow it affects other people, and that is immoral at best and downright evil\nat worst.\nBill\n",
