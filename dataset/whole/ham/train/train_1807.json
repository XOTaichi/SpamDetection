    "body": "URL: \nDate: Not supplied\nGreat piece on the pulp comic characters that appear in the new series of Alan \nMoore's _League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Tom Strong_ (thanks, Zed) funnybook. \nThese characters, like The Terror and The Fighting Yank, are in the public \ndomain because their original publishers didn't register (or renew, it's \nunclear) their copyright, which means that they've been granted a new lease on \nlife in _Tom Strong_. The article segues into a very good discussion of the \npublic domain. This was just Slashdotted, so it might be a little slow, but \nit's worth the wait.
