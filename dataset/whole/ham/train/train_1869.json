I run exmh on my desktops at home and at work with the resulting\nexmh windows being displayed on both my work and home desktops (gratis\nSSH X11 forwarding). In fact, your message was read and replied to\n(this message) while at work, using an exmh instance running on my home\nmachine.\n-- \nJ C Lawrence \n---------(*) Satan, oscillate my metallic sonatas. \nclaw@kanga.nu He lived as a devil, eh?\t\t \n Evil is a name of a foeman, as I live.\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-users mailing list\nExmh-users@redhat.com\n",
