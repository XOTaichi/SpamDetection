There are still people who only have one partner.\nThere are many more whoe only have one partner over \"long\"\nperiods of time. So it is far from \"vacuous\" to describe some\npeople as \"promiscuous\" and others as \"not promiscuous\", \nespecially over a set period. (\"He was promiscuous in college.\nHe is no longer promiscuous.\")\nThe word has a clear meaning, despite your continuing tendency \nto gloss that meaning over with population averages. \n> >Consider a population of 3 males and 3 females.\n> >[...]\n> >so in this contrived population, females are more \"promiscuous\" than males,\n> \n> So 1 girl gets 1 guy, 2 girls get 2 guys, 2 guys get 1 girl, 1 guy\n> gets 3 girls. Sounds like six of one versus half a dozen of the other\n> to me.\nOK, then. Consider a population of 1,000,000. 500,000 men each\npair off with 500,000 women. Then, 1 man, let's call him \"Wilt\",\nalso has sex with the other 499,999 women. \n499,999 women have had more than one partner. 499,999 men have\nonly had one partner. It is now \"perfectly obvious\" that in the\ncommon meaning of the term, among this contrived population, \nthat women are \"more promiscuous\" than men -- even though the\nsingle \"most promiscuous\" person, Wilt, is a man. \n\"Promiscuity\" is not \"exactly, perfectly identical between males \nand females\", except under a degenerate custom definition of\n\"promiscuity\".\n> >unless \"promiscuity\" is defined uselessly.\n> \n> Ain't nothin' useless about averages.\nAverages are useful, sure -- but much more so if called by their \nactual name, rather than conflated with another concept.\n- Gordon\n",
