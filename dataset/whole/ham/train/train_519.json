I \njust decided to check that vs. reality, and yes, speed has left the \nscene somewhere between the release of 2.5 and now.\nI checked on a number of small messages in a big folder (~10000 \nmsgs). The delay of the Next button has increased considerably:\n2.5-release: 350-450 msec\nlatest cvs: 1000-12000 msec\nFrankly I think this is getting close to non-acceptable since the \nuser settings hasn't changed.\nAnybody have any ideas where performance disappeared?\n/Anders\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-workers mailing list\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\n",
