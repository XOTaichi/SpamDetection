    "body": "LOL! They're not doomed at all. Thousands of men wear cb2000s to work \nevery day (along with other chastity devices). They are not just \ndecorations. You will not get a woody or have an orgasm until your \nkeyholder allows you to. Anyhow, I know better than to have this \ntype of conversation with a 'nilla, but these men wear these happily, and \nconsensually. (: There is little power struggle in the lifestyles of the \npeople who use these. There is power exchange instead. Lots of \nvariations on the definition, but this one's from Gloria Brame's site:\nPower exchange: the consensual transfer of power by the submissive to the \ndominant. The exchange takes place when the returned energy from the \ndominant empowers the submissive. \nAnyhow, there are tons of informative sites out there for anyone who cares \nto read them, but I assure you, the chastity device business is doing very \nwell, and it is illegal to force someone to wear one. It's not coercion, \nit is creative sensuality.
