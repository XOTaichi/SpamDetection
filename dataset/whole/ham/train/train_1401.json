I knew Mac OS X included a lot of grat fonts[2]\n, but I don't know how I overlooked this. (Matthew Carter, I'd be happy to pay \nyou the two cents in royalties you probably get for selling $100 worth of \nfonts.) \nTufte notes: Terrie Miller[3]. \nFirst ammendement beer bash. \niSync Beta[4] (guess they learned a lesson from iCal) is out.\n[1] \n[2] \n[3] \n[4] \n",
