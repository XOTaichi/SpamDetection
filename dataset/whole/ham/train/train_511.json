It is the\ndarkness of the soul that has lost its way.\" The war we fight is not\nagainst powers and principalities - it is against chaos and despair.\nGreater than the death of flesh is the death of hope, the death of\ndreams. Against this peril we can never surrender. The future is all\naround us, waiting in moments of transition, to be born in moments of\nrevelation. No one knows the shape of that future, or where it will take\nus. We know only that it is always born in pain.\n--JWS\n",
