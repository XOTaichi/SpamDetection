(I did look at 2.5.1, too).\nAnd, I just did this off the top of my head (I wanted to see if it\n(**) still worked), so this is somewhat untested.\nAdding a menu entry is trivial; add this to your ~/.exmh/exmh-defaults:\n*Fops.more.m.uentrylist:\tketchup\n*Fops.more.m.l_ketchup:\t\tCatch-up all b4 cur\n*Fops.more.m.c_ketchup:\t \tMy_Mark2CurSeen\nThen you just need to provide the source for My_Mark2CurSeen and \narrange for Exmh to include it (put it in your ~/.tk/exmh directory\nin your user.tcl; or in pick.patch if you enable the \"source hook\"\nunder Prefs->Hacking Support)\nIt's going to look something like this:\nproc My_Mark2CurSeen {} {\n global exmh pick msg\n Exmh_Status \"Clearing unseen up to cur...\" red\n Mh_SetCur $exmh(folder) $msg(id)\n set pick(ids) [...get message ids for \"pick 1-cur\"...]\n busy PickMarkSeen\n Exmh_Status ok blue\n}\n(that's based upon the guts of Pick_MarkSeen)\nYou need to fill in the code for the [...get...] section; I ran out of\ntime!\nJohn\n(*) \"It just works\" (tm)\n(**) \"it\" == my head\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-workers mailing list\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\n",
