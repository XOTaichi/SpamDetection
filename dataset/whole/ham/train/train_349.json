That will do it (every time).\nThat is: 0 ^h -\nOnce you get into that state, the same traceback occurs for every\ncharacter you type, until a message is selected with the mouse.\nThis is looking like it might be easy to find and fix, so I'll take a\nlook at it later.\nkre\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-workers mailing list\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\n",
