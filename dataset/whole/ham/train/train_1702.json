So we popped it onto a box\ndownstairs and wow - it is fast. Comes with some lovely client tools\nalso. Supports all the db goodies, transactions, stored procedures,\ntriggers.\n> It's really amazing to think how much they've got\n> out of a db that is only 4 MB in size - that's 10\n> times smaller than the Oracle *_client_*.\n> \n> \n> Having said all of the above, Oracle is really\n> a super product, but ya pays ya money...\n> \nIBM's db2 is another cheaper alternative to Oracle.
