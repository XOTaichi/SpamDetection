There are an awful lot of \n them here, and the ones I looked at were surprizingly readable. I was \n looking for the Balfour Declaration, the thing I saw cited as the start of \n Israel recently. Suprizingly this document is only four paragraphs. The \n Oslo Accords (Israel/PLO agreement of 1993) is another thing much shorter \n than I had imagined. \nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Eli!_)\n[1] \n[2] \n",
