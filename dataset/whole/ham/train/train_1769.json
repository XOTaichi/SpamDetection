Politics are somehow more muddy now? I'd say that \nits considerably\nclearer - the vast majority of people feel disenfranchised, and the \ncommon practice of\nputting protestors in boxes is done usually to hide them from TV \ncameras, visiting dignitaries,\netc, further exacerbating those feelings.\n\"Unpeaceably disrupting political rallies\" is now usually done by police \nwith riot gear and pepper spray.\nWe had a good one here a month or so ago - a few people peaceably \nstrayed from the permit area,\nwhich was nearly a mile from the site of the meeting of finance \nministers held here (the motorcade drove\nby it for about 10 seconds), and were immediately gassed, beaten and \narrested. Not very muddied at all.\nOwen\n",
