In Zimbabwe which was once the bread basket of the\nregion, some six million people are estimated to need food aid.\nThe WFP says it already has aid pledges for about half of the 600,000 tonnes\nof food it intends to bring into Zimbabwe in the next few months.\nThe government blames the shortages solely on drought, but the government's\ncampaign to transfer land from large scale commercial white farmers has\nworsened the situation, say many donors.\nLost markets\nThe GM row has complicated relief efforts across the region.\nZambia's president is refusing to overturn his ban on GM food aid, labelling\nit as 'poison' .\nDeals to mill GM food before being distributed, so that it could not be\nplanted, have placated fears in Malawi and Mozambique.\nUnited States aid officials deny that the food is unsafe, pointing out that\nAmericans eat GM maize every day.\nThe World Health Organisation has certified the grain for human consumption\nand says it does not constitute a danger to people's health.\n------------------------ Yahoo!
