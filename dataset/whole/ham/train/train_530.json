The specification is huge\nand clients do all kinds of weird stuff. POP is very easy in\ncomparison. Perhaps you could forward messages to a special address or\nsave them in a special folder to mark them as false negatives.\nAlternatively, perhaps there could be a separate protocol and client\nthat could be used to review additions to the training set. Each day a\nfew random spam and ham messages could be grabbed as candidates.\nSomeone would periodically startup the client, review the candidates,\nreclassify or remove any messages they don't like and add them to the\ntraining set.\n Neil\n",
