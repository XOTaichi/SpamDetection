Faxing, like a web form,\ncan be done 24x7; it allows me to give\nall the (and only the) pertinent info\nin a single place; it also provides a\nself-journalled correspondence, which\nmeans rollback is easy and replay is\neven easier.\n-Dave\n> Sure, tiled windows were the best we had for\n> a brief period of time, but they are completely useless\n> except for some terminal based replacement applications. \nI've been running a tiled (but somewhat\noverlapped, yielding a horizontal stack)\nwindow manager lately. Like filling in\na web form, finding edges and shuffling\nwindows may seem productive, but I find\nthat having a window manager manage the\nwindows means I can concentrate on what\nI want to do with their contents.\n:::::::::\n\"dumb question: X client behind a firewall?\"\n> Back in my day, they didn't have ssh.
