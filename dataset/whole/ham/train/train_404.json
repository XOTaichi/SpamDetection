But as a suggestion, have an\n\"all unknown\" sequence highlight, any message in a sequence which has\nno defined highlighting (where defined includes defined to not be treated\nspecially) gets highlighted the same way (maybe something as boring as\na dark brown text colour - almost indistinguishable from the normal black)\n | > > Any chance of making the current message a little brighter background?\n | \n | I don't see any reason why not. Experiment and let me know what works for you.\nDone some of that. First, the most significant change came from changing\nrelief from raised to sunken. I don't know why, but it just looks better\n(for me anyway). But even with that, cur and unseen are still just a\nbit too similar. I ended up using\n*sequence_cur: -background {PaleGoldenrod} -relief sunken -borderwidth 2\nThe unnecessary braces are just because some of the colours I was using\nhad spaces in their names. PaleGoldenrod translates as #eee8aa which\nis probably safer for generic use.\nkre\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-workers mailing list\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\n",
