I think the\nlaws specialing out hate and protected speech\nare ridiculous. The point I keep trying to make\nis that there's only two types, speech and action. \nI agree, they are all speech and should be \ncovered by the First Amendment, but\nIf hate speech is so protected, why are certain\nstates trying to prosecute people for it? There's\nonly two answers and one of them is wrong.\n 1) Because hate speech is different and needs to\n have a different level of protection dictated\n by whoever's offended at the time.\n 2) It's because it's not just speech, but action.\n A action who's consequences are foreseeable by \n any reasonable person. \nHate speech is mislabeled. It's really \"threat\". I think\nthey let the mislabeling perpetuate as there's advantage\nin being able to counter-threat with loss of liberty and\nmoney through civil and criminal lawsuits for people THEY\ndon't like. \nGreg\n> _________________________________________________________________\n> Join the world?s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail.\n> \n",
