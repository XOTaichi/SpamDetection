    "body": "\nDon't know much about eRoom - but there is the magic phrase 'collaborate in\nreal-time'... Groove really has people running scared. Wonder if any users\nactually /benefit/ from collaborating in real-time.\n===\nContent-management vendor Documentum said late Thursday it plans to acquire\nprivately held e-Room Technologies in a deal worth about $100 million.\nDocumentum will issue approximately 7.7 million shares of its common stock\nand pay about $12.6 million in cash for all of the outstanding shares of\neRoom.\nDocumentum makes a platform for enterprise-wide content management. ERoom\nmakes tools for enterprise collaboration. Its customers include Airbus,\nBausch & Lomb, Ford Motor Co., and Sony.\nDocumentum announced plans this summer to deliver a new Collaboration\nEdition of its content-management suite. ERoom was already integrating its\ntools to the Documentum platform, making an acquisition an easy target,\naccording to Documentum president and CEO Dave DeWalt.\nWith the upcoming joint product, customers will be able to collaborate in\nreal-time via virtual workspaces, sharing schedules, resources, and even\njointly creating content.\nContent creation and management has always been a collaborative task, but\nworkflow has usually been delivered via a Web browser interface or even\nsimple e-mail -- and rarely in real-time.\nFor now, Documentum will sell the eRoom platform and its own\ncontent-management system through combined sales channels. Further\nintegration is planned down the line, the companies said.\n",
