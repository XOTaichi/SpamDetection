    "body": "URL: \nDate: Not supplied\nI've put up a page called \"12 Reasons to Pre-Order Down and Out in the Magic \nKingdom,\" with blurbs by twelve people telling you why they think you should \nbuy it. Here're the blurbers: \n- Bruce Sterling \n- Lawrence Lessig \n- Kelly Link \n- Mark Frauenfelder \n- Karl Schroeder \n- Rudy Rucker \n- Howard Rheingold \n- Douglas Rushkoff \n- Tim O'Reilly \n- Bruce Schneier \n- Gardner Dozois \n- Mitch Kapor \nAnd the blurbs are great, like this one: \n Wow! Disney imagineering meets nanotechnology, the reputation economy, and \n Ray Kurzweil's transhuman future. As much fun as Neal Stephenson's Snow \n Crash, and as packed with mind bending ideas about social changes cascading \n from the frontiers of science. \n Tim O'Reilly\n Publisher and Founder, O'Reilly and Associates \n(_NB: This used to be 13 reasons, but I just realized that I somehow ended up \nwith a phantom entry from Dan GIllmor, who, on closer examination, it appears I \nfailed to deliver a copy to, like a total idiot. My apologies, Dan_) Link[1] \nDiscuss[2]\n[1] \n[2] \n",
