    "body": "\nBroadband's killer application  the one activity that dwarfs all others \nis online gaming, which 80 percent of South Koreans under 25 play, according\nto one recent study. Critics say the burgeoning industry is creating\nmillions of zombified addicts who are turning on and tuning into computer\ngames, and dropping out of school and traditional group activities, becoming\nuncommunicative and even violent because of the electronic games they play.\n\"Game players don't have normal social relationships anymore,\" said Kim Hyun\nSoo, a 36-year-old psychiatrist who is chairman of the Net Addiction\nTreatment Center, one of many groups that have sprung up to cope with\nInternet game addiction. \"Young people are losing the ability to relate to\nothers, except through games. People who become addicted are prone to\nviolence, even when they are not playing.\n- Jim\n",
