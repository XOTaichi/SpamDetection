    "body": "URL: \nDate: Not supplied\nArticle about a scam expert who belives the mom who beat her child is a grifter \nbelonging to the Irish Travelers. The reason she beat up her little girl, he \nthinks, is becasue she was pissed that the kid blew her con at a toy store. \n Wright believes the beating happened for one of two reasons. \"The little \n girl gave away the scam to an employee or the mom was so ticked off at not \n getting refunds she took it out on the little girl.\" \nI don't know anything about the Irish Travelers, but I'm wondering if they are \ngetting a bad rap about being con-artists. This Irish Traveler FAQ[1] says \n\"some Travellers are con men, but, just like other Americans, most are not.\" \nLink[2] Discuss[3]\n[1] \n[2] \n[3] \n",
