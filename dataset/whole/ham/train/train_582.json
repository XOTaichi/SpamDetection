    "body": "URL: \nDate: Not supplied\nThe DoE has announced a high-speed data-transfer that runs on drillpipe, \nthrough \"a 4-inch diameter steel pipe immersed in electrically conductive mud \nat pressures up to 1000 atmospheres, temperatures up to 150 deg C, and with \nvibrational accelerations of hundreds of g's:\" \n Now, with a high-speed, bi-directional communications link, a drilling \n system's azimuth, inclination, pressure, temperature, loads and vibration, \n along with information on rock characteristics near the drill bit, can be \n evaluated almost instantly. Also, because of the ability to send high-speed \n data through the drill pipe, technologies once thought unobtainable such \n as collecting seismic data at the drill bit may now be possible. \n With high-resolution seismic data collected \"ahead of the bit,\" operators \n could steer the drill bit more precisely toward oil- and gas-bearing sweet \n spots and away from less productive areas. This will enhance the efficiency \n of oil and gas wells and reduce the number of wells needed to produce a \n reservoir. \nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_via /.[3]_)\n[1] \n[2] \n[3] \n",
