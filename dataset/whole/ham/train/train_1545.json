    "body": "\nI have a couple of small issues, and I'm not sure if their exmh issues\nor my setup issues.\nFirst, when I try and run exmh with wish from tk8.4.0 it seems to take\nforever to start, but with wish from tk8.a.4 it starts in a snap.\nUsing the latest CVS, when I open exmh and the folder I'm in has unseen\nmessages and I hit next, exmh changes to the next folder with unseen messages\nrather than to the first unseen in the current folder.\nFinally, when I reach the end of the messages in a folder and go on to\nthe next unseen, exmh always goes back to inbox (which has no unseen\nmessages) rather than the next folder with unseen messages. (When I \ngoto next from inbox it does go where I would think it should go).\nJust wanted to let you know what I'm seeing and find out if I'm expecting\nsome different than I should be.\nThanks for all the effort\nJim\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-workers mailing list\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\n",
