I think the message that's being incorrectly highlighted as current\nis related to the current message in the other folder rather than being n+1.\nI'll have to investigate a bit more to identify and fix the bug, but there is \nsomething going on here.\nChris\n-- \nChris Garrigues \nvirCIO \n716 Congress, Suite 200\nAustin, TX 78701\t\t+1 512 374 0500\n World War III: The Wrong-Doers Vs. the Evil-Doers.\n",
