RATS scans source\ncode, finding potentially dangerous function calls. The goal of this\nproject is not to definitively find bugs. The current goal is to provide\na reasonable starting point for performing manual security audits.\nProduced by [0]Secure Software\" Uses a database so you can alter what you\nwant it to look for. Not a replacement for using stricture or your head\nbut is a good place to start some security auditing on your Perl.\nDiscuss this story at:\n \nLinks:\n 0. \nCopyright 1997-2002 pudge.
