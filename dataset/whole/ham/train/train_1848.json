    "body": "The Times\n September 06, 2002\n \n Scissors are a snip for Third World\n From Richard Owen in Rome\n \n \n \n IT IS one of the unanswered questions of the past year: what happens to the\n millions of nail scissors confiscated by airport security officials from\n passengers hand luggage? Most are thrown away or recycled after being seized\n as part of security measures since September 11. But an enterprising chaplain\n is sending them to Catholic missionaries for distribution to Third World\n hospitals and clinics. In theory travellers who have left nail scissors, nail\n files, corkscrews or manicure sets from their hand luggage can arrange for\n them to be returned. In practice many just shrug and leave the scissors by the\n X-ray scanners. \n \n Father Arturo Rossini, chaplain of Malpensa airport in Milan, said that\n scissors were costly or unavailable in many parts of Africa, Asia and Latin\n America. \n \n He told Corriere della Sera that he had plucked up the courage to ask the\n authorities if he could have the confiscated scissors. With the help of a\n retired airport policeman, he had packaged 60,000 nail scissors and manicure\n sets, using the airport chapel as a packing centre. \n \n Packages were shipped in aircraft holds to Peru, Brasil, India, Mozambique,\n Argentina, Zambia and Kenya. In such countries, what we think of as a\n personal grooming accessory can be a vital tool. \n \n The idea has been taken up at other Italian airports. \n \n \n------------------------ Yahoo!
