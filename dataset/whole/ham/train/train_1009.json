If not, why?\nShould. Haven't tried with dist-upgrade but I have put 7.2 netboot\nmirror (ie, 7.2) into sources.list and run install step-by-step for IIRC\neverything. Worked ok. I think there'll be a few .rpmnew files worth\nchecking such as, especially, passwd and group.\nI think there was a group change. \"lock\" ?\n-- \nIt feels great to wake up and not know what day it is, doesn't it?\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\n",
