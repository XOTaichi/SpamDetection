As a \nstop-gap to the auto-ham ..\nHow about adding an IMAP server with a spam and deleted-ham folder. Most email \nclients can handle IMAP. Users should be able to quickly move \"spam\" into the spam \nfolder. \nInstead of deleting messages (or, by reprogramming the delete function) they can \nquickly move ham into the ham folder.\nIn either case, the message would be processed and then destroyed.\nBrad Clements, bkc@murkworks.com (315)268-1000\n (315)268-9812 Fax\nAOL-IM: BKClements\n",
