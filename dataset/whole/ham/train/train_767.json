    "body": "URL: \nDate: Not supplied\nDaniel Berlinger has noticed[1] that Mac software shops are starting to move to \nOS X-only development. This makes sense, for two reasons. First, most people \nwho pay for software have new computers. So while OS X may only have a small \nfraction of the installed base, it has the majority of the population of people \nwho are opening their wallets. Second, if OS X isn't successful, the Mac is _\nover_. It's not like System 9 is getting any more popular. \nThen again, there are very few conditions under which it is actually the right \nbusiness decision to develop software for the Macintosh. Developing for the Mac \nis not a whole lot different than creating a web site _that only works on \nNetscape_. (Given the market share of Macs[2] (about 3.5%) and the market share \nof Netscape[3] (about 3.4%), that is not a silly comparison.) \nRobb Beal wrote[4]: \"Try this test. Go to a venture firm, angel, or big company \nwith a Mac OS X product/concept/prototype. Do they consider the fact that it's \na Mac application a net plus? (No.)\" Well _duh_. Your product would have to \nappeal to _25 times more Mac _users_ _[as a percentage] than Windows users just \nto break even. In other words, if your Windows product appeals to 1 in 100 \nWindows users, you have to appeal to 25 in 100 Mac users to make the same \namount of money. \nNow, you may want to make an _emotional_ appeal to developing for the Mac. \nThat's fine. If you like Macs and you're doing it for fun, more power to ya. \nBut as long as we're talking _investment_, you have to tell me why you're going \nto get 25 times as many users. Maybe there's less competition in your category \non the Mac; maybe you're in a niche like graphics where it seems like Macs \ndominate (they don't, it just seems that way because the elite graphics people \nin big American cities use Macs); maybe your product can't sell to mixed \nenvironments unless it runs everywhere. But if you want to make an investment \nin Mac software be prepared to demonstrate how you're going to overcome that \nmagic 25 multiplier.\n[1] \n[2] \n[3] \n[4] \n",
