    "body": "\n==\nMicrosoft Tuesday said it has purchased a Mountain View, Calif.-based\nsecurity company to better secure its core file services including its\nWindows platform and .NET initiative.\nThe Redmond, Wash-based software giant has acquired the assets of XDegrees\nfor an undisclosed amount of cash and is in the process of relocating the\nteam of 12 or 14 engineers to the Microsoft campus.\nXDegrees' technology assigns URLs to Word files, video clips, and other\ndigital documents for access across a peer-to-peer network\nXDegrees founder Michael Tanne was offered a job, but decided instead to\nplay his hand in the Silicon Valley.\n==========\n\"XDegrees' technology assigns URLs to Word files, video clips, and other\ndigital documents for access across a peer-to-peer network\" - assigns URLs\nto Word files... and somebody /bought/ that?\n===\n\"The XDegrees System allows users to easily and consistently locate, access\nand manage information by assigning each document a unique link. Providing\nend-to-end security, the XDegrees System unifies authentication of all\nusers, provides file-level access control and encrypts all stored and\ntransferred files. Seamless integration with existing applications such as\nemail clients and Microsoft Office products allows companies to rapidly\ndeploy the XDegrees System and users to get up-and-running quickly.\"\nWhoa... high tech...\n===\nMore bits here...\n\"The essence of XDegrees consists of a naming system and a distributed\ndatabase that allows peers to resolve resource names. XDegrees manages these\nservices for customers on its own hosts, and sells its software to\nenterprises so they can define and run their own namespaces on in-house\nservers. You can search for a particular person (whatever device the person\nis currently using), for a particular device, for a file, or even for a web\nservice. The software that resolves resource names is called XRNS (the\neXtensible Resource Name System).\"\n",
