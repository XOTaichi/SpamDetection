New Tokyo toities \nsport speech-recognition, air-conditioning, and body-chemistry monitors: \n Japan's toilet wars started in February, when Matsushita engineers here \n unveiled a toilet seat equipped with electrodes that send a mild electric \n charge through the user's buttocks, yielding a digital measurement of \n body-fat ratio. \n Unimpressed, engineers from a rival company, Inax, counterattacked in April \n with a toilet that glows in the dark and whirs up its lid after an infrared \n sensor detects a human being. When in use, the toilet plays any of six \n soundtracks, including chirping birds, rushing water, tinkling wind chimes, \n or the strumming of a traditional Japanese harp. \nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, May[3]!_)\n[1] \n[2] \n[3] \n",
