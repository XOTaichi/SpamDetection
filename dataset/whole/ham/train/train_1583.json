The subscription rate is\n$12 a year. They need 3,000 subscriptions to move forward (no word if\nexisting subscriptions will be honored, or included in the 3,000).\n[0]Read the site for more details.\nI think some of the more interesting notes are that it will include \"a\nhealthy dose of opinion\", as well a broadening of coverage including\nlanguages other than Perl (will this mean a name change?) and platforms\nother than Unix (I'd always thought one of TPJ's strengths was that it\ncovered a wide variety of platforms).\nDiscuss this story at:\n \nLinks:\n 0. \nCopyright 1997-2002 pudge.
