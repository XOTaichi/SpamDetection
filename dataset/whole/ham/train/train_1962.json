    "body": "URL: \nDate: Not supplied\nI feel so tremendously validated right now in all my criticisms of Netscape vs. \nMozilla. I told Netscape management that if the Netscape beta shipped without \npopup blocking that CNet would write an article on it. They didn't believe me \n(or didn't care). Sure enough, the article appeared right on time[1].\nI blogged about two main annoyances when installing Netscape 7: the lack of \npopup blocking and all of the annoying advertising spam on the desktop and in \nthe toolbars. I warned Netscape that they needed to take steps to correct this \nproblem. They didn't listen. Take a look at the CNet review[2] highlight that \ndescribes *The Bad* part of Netscape 7.0:\n_Displays AOL ads everywhere; doesn't let you turn off pop-up windows like \nMozilla does; devours 30MB of disk space._\nPlenty of other engineers at Netscape (as well as managers) complained about \nthese problems and fought with those higher up to correct these problems. We \nlost every battle. The simple truth is that the people in charge of running the \nNetscape browser are incompetent. They don't understand how to make a good \nbrowser, or they don't care. Their engineers tell them what they're doing \nwrong, and they don't listen. \nMaybe you'll listen to the public. How about eWeek's article, Netscape 7.0 \nShrivels Under Mozilla's Shadow[3]? Are you paying attention now, you ignorant, \nstupid, incompetent buffoons?\n\"I told you so.\" never felt so good.\nMaybe they will sit up and take notice now. If they do, well, it's about \nfucking time. And people wonder why I quit working for AOL.\n[1] \n[2] \n[3] \n",
