IMHO.\nBS> Bill\nNo offense or anything, but there's a difference between holding a\nsign that doesn't agree with Bush and screaming at him.\nMy sole point, as far as the 1st Amendment goes is that there is more\nto this game than just being an angry, liberal youth. (Which is the\ngross culmination of everyone's argument sofar) The screaming isn't\nthe most effective method around. I don't believe I argued that it\nwas. But screaming is happening because the means to communicate to\nthe representatives involved are diminishing, at least as far as the\npeople doing the screaming are concerned. For the record, I don't\nsupport the screamers in organized conferences (Such as the Colin\nPowell shout-down that was mentioned earlier). I don't think that\nthis is what the 1st Amendment was implying. These folks -do- have a\nright to be heard, and I think they have a right to be heard by the\nfolks they elected in the first place.\nMy point, (my only point) was really more concerned with the cases\nsuch as Mr. Nell. He wasn't engaged (at least from the limited facts\nwe have) in a shoutout, but rather in a difference of opinion. He\nhas a right to possess this opinion and make it known to the\nrepresentatives that are elected. A sign is not a shout-out.\nI think I may have missed (or not accurately addressed) the original\nthread switch that took this example and mixed in the screaming\ndissenters to the mix. I was mostly responding with my miffedness in\nhaving broad-brush strokes applied to a group without examining the\npolicy reasons that might have contributed to it. IN this case, the\nscreaming parties are fed up with getting corralled miles away from\nthe folks they need to speak with. They're resorting to creative,\noffensive and constitutionally challengable means, but its not simply\ndue to the fact that they're 20 and have lost all decorum. The 'My\ngeneration never did this ' is all BS. THere's more to this story,\nwe just dont' know it all.\nI hope this clarifies my position. For the quick rehash:\nScreaming != Free speech on all cases.\nDissent = Free speech, provided you follow what has been laid down by\nthe Supremes.\nK?\n-- \nBest regards,\n bitbitch mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net\n",
