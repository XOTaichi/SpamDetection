If they do, the decision could be a turning point \nin redefining a balance between copyright consumers and producers and the \ntechnology companies that are often in the middle.\" \nNewsweek: Glitterati vs. Geeks[3]. \"Larry Lessig admits it: hes nervous. Who \nwouldnt be? [...] In its narrowest context, Eldred v. Ashcroft deals with the \nseemingly arcane issue of the length of copyrights for books, films and music. \nBut its actually a high-noon showdown between two great industries at odds in \nthe age of the Internet.\" 'Theres a sense of deja vu to this. Television was \nsupposed to be the death of movies. And in 1982, the film industrys \nsilver-tongued lobbyist Jack Valenti testified that the VCR is to the American \nfilm producer and the American public as the Boston strangler is to the woman \nhome alone. (Video sales are now the studios biggest moneymaker.) Naturally, \nHollywood regards the computer/Internet combo as scarier than Nightmare on Elm \nStreet.'\n[1] \n[2] \n[3] \n",
