Unfortunately for her, the government has no plans to shoot rocks of \ncocaine at demonstrators, so she'll still have to depend on her drug dealer for \nthat. \n The U.S. military is exploring ways to use drugs such as Valium to calm \n people without killing them during riots or other crowd control situations \n where lethal weapons are inappropriate. \nLink[1] Discuss[2]\n[1] \n[2] \n",
