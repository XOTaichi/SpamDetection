Over the last month or so, I've been making strenuous efforts to\ncontact all of the groups we had listed to see which ones were still\nactive. What you see is the result of this exercise. Almost half of the\ngroups have been removed because they haven't responded to my emails.\nIf your local group still exists but is no longer listed, then that means\nthat I don't have an update to date contact for your group.
