    "body": "\nHow is this any different from attaching an Infobot or A.L.I.C.E\nthrough licq's console-hook? People have been doing that for years,\nand for over a decade in IRC and the MUDs.\n... and the one thing I think we've learned in all that time is that,\nas a help-desk, it doesn't work. People just don't like talking to\nrobots, especially when the robots, once confused, become imbeciles.\nI think the humans may feel cheated, deceived and tricked when they\ndiscover, as with the Seattle answer, that they are talking to a\nmachine; there's no real intelligence behind that simulated-friendly\nand therefore empty 'thx'.\nAIML is clever and cute, but for /practical/ applications as a first\nline of technical support? It's been tried over and over, and while I\n/also/ think that it /should/ work, for the most part, people won't\nuse it. What's worse, as we make the NL processing more and more\nclever, it only means it fails more dramatically; ALICE doesn't just\nstumble a bit, it starts to drool. And ALICE is the best we have.\nLike a Dalek: All very impressive when things are going well, but all\nit takes to betray the chicken-brain inside is a towel over it's\nill-placed eye, or a spin off the metal surface ;)\nIn all the prolog-based NL database query systems of the 1980's and\nother later chatterbot helpdesk projects like Shallow Red, even\nsimpler tries like Ask Jeeves, people very quickly know they're\ntalking to a robot, and the queries anneal to short, truncated and\nterse database-like verb-noun or just noun-keyword requests. \nPeople are just too quick to adapt, and too impatient to forgive a\nclunky interface, and for now, especially when the /average/ computer\nuser still can't type more than maybe 5-10wpm, NL is a painfully slow\nclunky interface.\nPut it this way: Would you login, wake the bot and ask for the Seattle\nweather, or would you do as we /all/ do and just click the weather\nicon sitting there on your desktop?\nJust for fun, here's an interesting conversation between Shallow Red,\nALICE and Eliza as they decide to play the Turing Game:\n-- \nGary Lawrence Murphy - garym@teledyn.com - TeleDynamics Communications\n - blog: - biz: -\n \"Computers are useless.
