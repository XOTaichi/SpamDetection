    "body": "\nLioness adopts fifth antelope\nRory Carroll, Africa correspondent\nTuesday October 8, 2002\nThe Guardian\nKamuniak the dysfunctional lioness has forfeited another meal by adopting\nher fifth baby oryx this year, an aberration of nature which has baffled\nwildlife experts.\nThe young lioness in the Samburu national park in northern Kenay adopted her\nlatest baby at the weekend, a wildlife service warden said yesterday.\nEach time Kamuniak, whose name means \"the blessed one\" in the local Samburu\ntongue, has tried to protect the antelopes from other predators and allowed\nthe natural mothers to feed them.\nUnfortunately for her, one oryx ended up in the belly of a male lion while\nKamuniak slept; the others were either rescued by wardens or retrieved by\ntheir natural mothers.\nThe wardens think the latest adoptee, nicknamed Naisimari (\"taken by\nforce\"), was adopted at the weekend.\n\"She must have adopted her on Sunday because they are in harmony,\" said\nGabriel Lepariyo, a warden.\nNaisimari's natural mother has been seen shadowing the odd couple at a\ndistance.\nTheories to explain the phenonemon abound: not having her own cubs, Kamuniak\nis lonely; she is colour-blind and short-sighted and thinks the calves are\ncubs; the oryx were too frail to flee, breaking the classic prey behaviour\nand confusing the hunter; Kamuniak wants to be a vegetarian; Kamuniak wants\nto be loved. \n------------------------ Yahoo!
