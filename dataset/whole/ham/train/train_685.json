    "body": " |::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::|\n IT's Monday 520 02 September 2002\n |::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::|\nSTUDENT LIFE BEGINS WITH LINUX\nby\nJohn Sterne\nThe launch last month of a marketing special interest group by the\nIrish Linux Users Group (ILUG) - open source and marketing, it\nseems, might not be mutually exclusive concepts - has already\nsparked an interesting initiative at University College Cork. When\nthe new academic year begins at UCC, every incoming student will\nbe offered a copy of Red Hat Linux 7.3.\nILUG member Braun Brelin proposed this promotion, when he ran a\ntraining class for staff at the UCC computer science department.\nBrelin, who is the director of technology at OpenApp, says that the\nLinux offer could be extended to any or all of the other Irish\nuniversities.\nThe user group is tapping into an international Red Hat programme\nthat aims to introduce students at all levels to the open source\nstyle of computing. The Linux distributor runs an 'educational\nchannel' to reach this audience, bundling educational software\nwith its operating environment and offering networked support\nservices to eligible applicants. This scheme was originally designed\nto suit the educational structures in the US, but is now available to\nschools and universities throughout the world.\nRed Hat Linux 7.3 incorporates ease of use and maintenance\nfeatures and is intended to counter objections that Linux is hard to\nmaster on personal systems.\nThe Linux-for-all project at UCC could also raise the profile of Red\nHat Ireland. Based in Cork, this operation has run shared financial\nservices for other Red Hat offices in Europe since 2000. Until now\nits involvement with users in Ireland has been fairly limited,\nalthough it does sometimes refer them to other Red Hat offices in\nEurope that offer consulting or technical support services.\nDavid Owens, Red Hat's director of global logistics and production,\nsees the formation of the ILUG marketing group as a reason to take\na more proactive approach. In the last three months, he notes, his\noffice in Cork has received more and more calls from Irish\ncompanies that are interested in adopting Linux and has introduced\nsome to Red Hat pre-sales consultants.\n-------------\nMany thanks are due to Braun and David for working together on this one.\nRegards\nL.\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\n for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n",
