You could start on my profile[1] and explore from \nthere, or enter the URL of your own FOAF file (at the bottom of the page). It's \nheavy on tech details, but you can easily see the potential here. (It's also a \ngreat way to debug your FOAF file, if you added anything manually.) Now we need \nsomebody to build a spider that follows foaf:knows links and draws pretty \nsocial network diagrams, so we can see the forest for the trees.\n[1] \n",
