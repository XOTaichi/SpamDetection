    "body": "URL: \nDate: Not supplied\nGregor sez: \n ENRON Corp material assets go on the block 7 AM CT TOMORROW, Wednesday, \n 9/25. First on the list is the giant, steel, Enron \"E\" (Lot \"E\"), followed \n by tons of cool tech. 50 inch plasma panels, desktop LC Displays, boxes of \n Palm PDAs or Nokia cell phones, network stuff, wireless stuff, desktop \n computers, servers, monitors, printers, plotters, in both massive lots, and \n individually! Oh yeah, Enron trade-show trinkets too, by the cartload. \n The catch: You have to either go to Texas to pick up the stuff, or arrange \n with an approved 3rd party vendor (list provided on the web site) to have \n it picked, packed and shipped for you. \n Go! Register! Bid! Consume! \nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Gregor!_)\n[1] \n[2] \n",
