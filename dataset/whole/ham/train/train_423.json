That's wrong,\nimmoral and unethical no matter what the political bent of the speakers and\nthe protesters. Rowdy protests in their own venue (on a college campus or\nsome of the commons areas of DC) is perfectly fine by me. Waving signs to\nget attention is fine.\n> That picture\n> will be dominating the news cycles in China, Iraq, Russia, Germany, and\n> France, at least.

Was he just jacking himself\noff at the expense of other people? Exactly why is it a shame that they were\nnot arrested? Think about what you are saying and what you are telegraphing\nabout your state of mind here. You WANT people to do bad things (ie, police\narresting peaceful protesters) if it can help you further your cause? That\nattitude just sucks. You have no moral ground to stand on if that is what\nyou believe.\n> It is part of the game -- make an ass of yourself, get your point on\n> the nightly\n> news, spend a couple days in the clink for disorderly.\nSure, just don't whine about getting arrested if you make it a point to get\nin someone's face.\nOne other comment... Most of the people that are protesting against taking\nout the Iraqi dictator wouldn't give a rats ass if a nuke went off in NYC.\nThey simply wouldn't care so why in the hell should the Americal public\nlisten to them on matters of national security?\nSo enlighten me, exactly why shouldn't Hussein be taken out? And if your\nanswr boils down to \"i don't give a shit about what happens to the US\", you\ncan kiss my ass :-)\nBill\n",
