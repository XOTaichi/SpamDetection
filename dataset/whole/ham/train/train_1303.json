I had similar problems as did several\nco-workers. Updating my Gnome components has fixed it for me and\nothers, although I can't say exactly which component did the\ntrick. Gnomecore or gtk would seem most likely, but it may have been\nsomething else.\nIn any case, I have not seen the problem for quite a while, now.\nR.
