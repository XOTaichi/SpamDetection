    "body": "\nAn investigation has been launched after punch bags on sale in Greenwich \nwere found to be stuffed with incontinence pads and bandages.\nTrading standards officers, working for Greenwich Council, were alerted to \nthe situation after a Bryan punch bag, purchased in Argos, in Charlton Road, \nCharlton, was found to be full of bandages.\nAlso stuffed inside the piece of sporting equipment was a letter from a \nwoman in Fife stating how she felt quite disgusted' about the bag and asking \nfor the filling to be tested.\nThe unfortunate shopper had bought his first bag, at Argos, in Lewisham High \nStreet, but had returned it because on investigation of a leak he was \nhorrified to discover it was filled with incontinence pads.\nSo far, officers have purchased two of the punch bags, only to find they \ncontain incontinence pads and strips of shredded duvet.\nCabinet member for public services Councillor Angela Cornforth said: \"This \nis one of the strangest stories I have every heard.\n\"Our officers are in the process of investigating and will no doubt discover \nwhy the bags contain such unusual contents.\"\n12:18 Tuesday 8th October 2002\n_________________________________________________________________\nChat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: \n------------------------ Yahoo!
