The result of such a thing is obvious.\nIf I got this all wrong, I'd be happy that you clarify a bit more and tell \nme where I might have misunderstood.\nMed venlig hilsen / Best regards,\n-Allan Jensen\nSi hoc signum legere potes, operis boni in rebus Latinus alacribus et \nfructuosis potiri potes!\n",
