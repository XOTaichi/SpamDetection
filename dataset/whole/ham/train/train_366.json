    "body": "Not fortean, but a moment in time all the same...\nBetamax video recorders are finally being phased out almost 20 years after\nlosing the battle for dominance of the home video market to VHS. \nBetamax's manufacturer, Sony, has announced that it will make only 2,000\nmore machines for the Japanese market. \nThey have not been on sale in the rest of the world since 1998. \n \nVHS became the dominant format by the mid-1980s\n \nBetamax was launched in 1975, and won many fans who said it was better\nquality than its VHS rival. \nSome 2.3 million Betamax machines were sold worldwide in its peak year,\n1984, but it soon went downhill as VHS became the format of choice for the\nfilm rental industry and in homes. \nJust 2,800 machines were sold in the 12 months to March 2002. \n\"With digital machines and other new recording formats taking hold in the\nmarket, demand has continued to decline and it has become difficult to\nsecure parts,\" Sony said in a statement. \nSony said it would continue to offer repairs and manufacture tapes for the\nformat. \nThe professional Betamax format, Betacam, is still widely used in the\ntelevision and film industries and will be unaffected. \nBut the recent rise of DVDs seems to have put the final nail in the coffin\nfor Betamax home players. \nIn the 1980s, many video rental chains preferred the VHS format. \nBetamax lovers became so passionate about the format in the face of\ncompetition from VHS that they set up the Betaphile Club in 1988. \nThe picture and sound quality of Beta was superior to VHS, Betaphiles say,\nalthough VHS tapes had a longer duration. \nA total of 18 million Betamax machines were sold around the world, but no\nnew ones will be made after the end of 2002. \nSony is now planning to focus its efforts on new digital technologies. \n See also:\n \n------------------------ Yahoo!
