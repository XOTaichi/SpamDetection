Neither Ted nor I were particularly up to date. I pulled \ndown the lates from CVS and am now running with it. I miss the \nblue ftoc lines but I'll sort that out soon, iirc Chris said \nit's a simple resource change.\nTed's code to \"ketchup\" made use of some of the procs that went \naway in the sequence generalization. I've fixed it up... almost \nand it looks like this now:\nproc Cabeen_Mark2CurSeen {} {\n global exmh mhProfile msg\n set results {}\n Exmh_Status \"Clearing unseen up to cur...\" red\n Mh_SetCur $exmh(folder) $msg(id)\n set unseen [Mh_Sequence $exmh(folder) $mhProfile(unseen-sequence) ]\n foreach elem $unseen {\n if { $elem <= $msg(id) } {\n lappend results $elem\n }\n }\n busy Seq_Del $exmh(folder) $mhProfile(unseen-sequence) $results\n Exmh_Status ok blue\n}\nThe \"almost\" is because it's not updating the highlighting on \nthe ftoc. I'm too tired to go figure out how to fix that just \nnow and have to move on to other stuff. If someone wants to \nforward me a clue feel free.\nNow that I've got all of Chris' sequence stuff I discovered that \nmy sequences are ... cluttered.\n--Hal\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-workers mailing list\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\n",
