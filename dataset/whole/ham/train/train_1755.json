(Matthew Carter, I'd be happy to pay you the two cents \nin royalties you probably get for selling $100 worth of fonts.) \n*Update:* Kevin Marks[1], who is stupendously incredible for far more things \nthan I can list here points out that Gill Sans (which I was asking for earlier) \nis _included with OS X_. I knew Mac OS X included a lot of great fonts[2], but \nI don't know how I overlooked this. _Awesome!_ \nTufte notes: Terrie Miller[3]. \nFirst ammendement beer bash. \niSync Beta[4] (guess they learned a lesson from iCal) is out.\n[1] \n[2] \n[3] \n[4] \n",
