    "body": "\"the historical record\", by which you mean *human* historical record, is\nhighly overrated (nigh worthless) when you are talking about geological\ntimescales, even on topics with as short a timescale as climate.\nMy problem with global warming (or cooling for that matter), is that the\nsupposedly profound recent changes in temperature, both in absolute\nterms and as a function time, very arguably fall well below the noise\nfloor of the natural fluctuations that have occurred over the last\n50,000 years both in terms of absolute average temperature and the rate\nof temperature change. People unfamiliar with history of global\ntemperature since the advent of modern humans may think that a degree\nhere or there over a century is a lot, not realizing that global\ntemperatures regularly whipsaw with far greater extremity. I therefore \nimmediately dismiss any theory of global warming that cannot explain why\ntemperatures whipsawed more severely in pre-history than in the last\ncouple thousand years (which have been relatively calm by geological\nstandards). This is a very inconvenient fact for people trying to use\nclimate to push a particular social agenda.\nIt is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers deposited\nduring the last major ice age, they are finding substantial evidence of\nhumans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glaciers\npaved over their civilization. The receding glaciers have turned into a\nbit of an archaeological treasure chest, as they expose artifacts buried\nin and underneath them as they shrink that have been preserved by the\nice for thousands of years. I don't see any compelling reason to \"save\nthe glaciers\" anyway, particularly in light of the fact that their\nexistence has always been transient.\nFor anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations are\nanthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another. I'll\njust stick with Occam's Razor for now.\nIn my humble opinion.\nCheers,\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\nOn Mon, 2002-09-23 at 12:23, Jim Whitehead wrote:\n> \n> For anyone to fully bury global warming, they would need to explain why the\n> dramatic increase in CO2 concentrations are not increasing the global\n> temperature.
