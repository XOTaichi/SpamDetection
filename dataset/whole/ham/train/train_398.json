You might find a\n16-wheeler this way, but how often do people misplace a 16-wheeler\nsuch that it is _that_ important to get old images of the terrain?\nSince they can't send up aircraft to update images in realtime every\ntime, how is this different from just releasing the map on DVDs? Why\nwireless?\nI thought of the common problem of lost prize cattle, but there again,\nwill there really be business-case for creating a hi-res map of\nwyoming on the fly instead of just doing what they do now and hiring a\nhelicopter for a few hours?\n K> For small areas you have legitimate access to, it's probably\n K> cheaper to go there with a digital camera and a GPS and take\n K> some snapshots from ground level.
