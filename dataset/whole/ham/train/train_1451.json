    "body": "\nBig cats are on the loose in Britain and breeding their way towards record\nnumbers, a monitoring group has claimed. \nThe British Big Cats Society said it has received more than 800 reports of\nanimals including pumas, black panthers, leopards and so-called Fen tigers\nover the past 12 months. \nAnd while it admits that many sightings are of nothing more exotic than the\naverage moggy, it claims to have \"firm evidence\" that the majority are real.\nSociety founder Daniel Bamping told BBC News Online he could cope with the\ncritics and doubters, adding: \"I was a sceptic, I thought it was in the same\nrealm as the Loch Ness monster. \n\"But it's not, they are really out there.\" \n'Cats with cubs' \nMr Bamping said there have been reports of big cats from every corner of the\ncountry. \nBig cat reports \nHotspots include Scotland and Gloucestershire \nJanuary 2002 - Kent man clawed by suspected Lynx \nNovember 2001 - farmer reports animals mauled by big cat \nApril 2001 - Lynx captured in north London \n1999 - Puma-like cat attacks horse in Wales \n\"This weekend alone I have had sightings from Wales, the Scottish borders,\nKent, the West Midlands, Devon, Somerset and Wiltshire,\" he said. \nThe society claims some of the big cats are breeding with domestic animals. \nBut Mr Bamping said others, particularly lynx and puma, probably exist in\nsufficient numbers to breed among themselves. \n\"We have had sightings of cats with cubs,\" he added. \n'Trigger camera' \nThe society claims to have evidence proving the cats' existence, including\nphotographs, paw prints, sheep kills and hair samples. \nBut it knows it will have to do even more to convince a sceptical public\nthat it is not spinning them a shaggy cat story. \nA national \"trigger camera\" project is planned which, the society hopes,\nwill provide footage to prove the existence of the big cats. \nMr Bamping said: \"The idea is that the cat will walk past the camera and\ntake a picture of itself.\" \n'Like dogs' \nThe society believes many of the sighting are of pets released into the\nwild, or their descendants. \nIts spokesman Danny Nineham said: \"In the 1960s and 1970s, people had big\ncats like leopards as pets and they used to walk them like dogs. \n\"But in 1976 when the Dangerous Wild Animals Act came into force, people\nreleased their cats because they did not want to pay for a licence, put them\ndown, or take them to a zoo.\"\n------------------------ Yahoo!
