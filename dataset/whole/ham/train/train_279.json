And that goes back to my second argument -- Cohen. THey can\nwalk away. NObody compells them to stand there, I'll agree fully.\nBut we still have a Constitutional right to speak out against\npolicies, actions and grievances.\nAgain. If you want it another way, lets change the Constitution.\n-- \nBest regards,\n bitbitch mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net\n",
