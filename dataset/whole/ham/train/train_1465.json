Added a second hard\ndisk\nfor Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which\nwent\nfine except it didn't pick up my monitor.\nI have a Dell branded E151FPp 15\" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia\nGeForce4\nTi4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's\ndefault\nset. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using\nRPM.\nThen I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net),\nbut\nit still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?\nAnother problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock\ntwice,\nthe whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch\nis\ninactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.\nIf anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -\nI've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.\nOr should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat?\nOpinions\nwelcome.\nThanks a lot,\nPeter\n--\nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\n for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\n for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n",
