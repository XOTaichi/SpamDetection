(The other stuff mentioned\nconcerns contract law, e.g., the required element of privity, etc.)\n> In the absence of such limitations, the original author has the right\n> to change his software back to closed on a whim.\nNo, the author has the right to issue _additional_ instances under a\ndifferent licence, such as a proprietary (\"closed\" [sic]) licence. \n> Rick Moen makes the point that it is not a sale but rather a granting\n> of rights which are not default. \n> \n> See the bit about even the granting of rights by an author having to\n> be explicitly specified - under French law.\nThe analysis, here and elsewhere, concerns contract law. This isn't\ncontract law.\nThis isn't the first time copyright attorneys have stumbled on this\nsubject. I'm sure it won't be the last.\n-- \nCheers, \"The front line of defense against such sophisticated \nRick Moen viruses is a continually evolving computer operating \nrick@linuxmafia.com system that attracts the efforts of eager software\n developers.\" -- Bill Gates \n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\n for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n",
