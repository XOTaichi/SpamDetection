    "body": "I attended the same conference, and was impressed by a few systems that\nJim didn't mention. In terms of CMS, the following all had apparently\nbeen used in some fairly large implementations and looked like some\npretty strong competition to commercial systems:\n- Midgard, , a PHP-based content\nmanagement framework that with other programs combines to be a full CMS\n- Redhat CCM CMS, Java-based: \n- OpenCMS, Java-based: \nThere was agreement that usability has not generally been an open source\nstrength, but both Plone and Xopus represented some real movement\ntowards improving that situation.\nI was impressed by the spectrum of perspectives on XML. Some took for\ngranted that XSLT was relevant to content management, others took it\njust as for granted that XSLT was irrelevant and seemed happy to ignore\nXML almost completely. \nI attended realizing that \"content management\" is generally used to\napply to *Web* content management, but I was still a bit shocked how\ncompletely out of scope document management was (almost no consideration\nof the potential print/PDF dimension to content other than the\noccasional \"...and you can use FOP to make PDF\" as if that was\nfunctional): this seems more the case in open source content management\nthan in commercial content management, and probably makes XML easier to\nignore (if HTML is the be-all and end-all of the output...).\nThe honesty was refreshing, Phil Suh complained about the state of\ncurrent tools (both open source and commercial), and I wish I'd written\ndown what he said, something like \"it sucks so extremely, it sucks so\nwidely, and it is so generally sucking, that it seems sometimes there is\nno hope.\" For a moment there was contemplation that perhaps commercial\nsystems scaled so well that the commercial \"big boys\" were really much\nmore functional than open source, until someone pointed out, \"OK, take\nsome average blog software, spend $500,000 on the rollout... it'll scale\npretty well.\" Another quote (citing Brendan Quinn): \"content management\nproblems are either trivial or impossible.\"\nMac OS X is getting popular, of the laptops there it was an even 1/3\neach of Mac, Linux, Windows.\nI am sure it wasn't news to Jim, but I can't wait to try Subversion, a\nCVS replacement that supports some of the newer features of WebDAV:\nI'm also eager to try Xopus, I hope the developers make it back home\nsafely, they said they'd only been in America four days but were already\nhomeless...\nMax\n",
