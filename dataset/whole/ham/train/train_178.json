When a W3C member company that helped create XHTML and CSS \nignores or misuses those web standards on its corporate site, you have to \nwonder who didn't get the memo.&#8221; \nThe new design also fails even the most basic accessibility tests[2]; the home \npage contains 80 instances of images without ALT text. This is the same basic \nfailing for which the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games was \nsuccessfully sued in 2000[3]. \nHere is what microsoft.com looks like in a text-only browser[4]. (To better \nunderstand the experience, take a piece of paper and cover your entire monitor \nexcept for the top line, then scroll the window slowly so you can only read one \nline at a time.) While nothing is technically locked out (all the links are \nregular links, nothing requires Javascript to function properly), all the \nun-ALT-enhanced images (which are mostly spacer images and images-as-bullets) \nadd so much clutter to the page that it's very difficult to navigate. \nMeanwhile, I don't want to imagine what it would sound like through a screen \nreader. Want to find the search box? That's &#8220;1pttrans dot gif 1pttrans \ndot gif search for 1pttrans dot gif 1pttrans dot gif form edit box 1pttrans dot \ngif submit button go 1pttrans dot gif link advanced search 1pttrans dot gif \n...&#8221; And I hope you weren't looking for Microsoft's accessibility home \npage[5]; it's the 76th link on the page (out of 76).\n[1] \n[2] \n[3] \n[4] \n[5] \n",
