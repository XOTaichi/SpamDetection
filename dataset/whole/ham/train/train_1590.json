This will go someplace interesting. \nI left a big hint there in the way the blogChannel module[3] is designed, \npatterned after the Syndication module[4] designed by the RDF folk. In other \nwords, the place where they're expressing discomfort with RSS 2.0 is where they \ncan make it their own. Lead. Instead of feeling disempowered, be powerful. \nAt one point I saw clearly where the compromise between RSS 0.9x and 1.0 was. \nWe could have gotten there in early 2001, so instead we get there in late 2002. \nSo what, not a big deal. Think about how much better it will be _when we're all \nadvocating the same format._ Visualize peace. That's basically what I did when \nI did the 2.0 spec. I know it's hard to swallow, but swallow anyway. If I did \nit, you can too.\n[1] \n[2] \n[3] \n[4] \n",
