They offer \ncompetitive prices; they can design the type of albums we want (with some \namount of artistic touchup); they do bridal and engagement portraits as well as \nfull wedding day coverage; they shoot all digital; and they give us all the \ndigital negatives on CD&#8212;that is, the raw pictures that come straight out \nof their cameras. No other photographer we met with came close.\n[1] \n[2] \n",
