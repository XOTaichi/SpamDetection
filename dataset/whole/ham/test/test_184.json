    "body": "the only way to insure a safe key is to use all the storage space in the\nuniverse. too big to decrypt.\nmy point is there will never be a \"safe\" key. what I would consider is how\nlong does the data need to be protected. if you need to protect the data for\nlonger than 6 months, do not release it to the public. if you are trying to\nstop the general public (your customer) from coping the data then use what\nis available on the market. If you want to stop the bootleggers do not\nrelease the data to the public.\nI have never seen a lock that could not be unlocked. the act of unlocking\nthe key gives away it's secret.\nthe tougher the lock the more pissed-off your customers will be. take MS-XP\nfor example. only the home user is forced to register. think of the\nnightmare if business had to register every copy. how many times have we\nneeded to reinstall our laptop OS? notice the amount of Mac's sold after the\nXP release. these where mostly home users that converted to Mac OS.\nthe new Audio CD's that have digital copy protection so not play on my\ncomputer. does this stop me from copying the CD? no. however it does make me\nreturn them and get my money back.\nthe more popular the software the more likely it is to be cracked.\njef\n",
