Consider a population of 1,000,000. 500,000 men each\n>pair off with 500,000 women. Then, 1 man, let's call him \"Wilt\",\n>also has sex with the other 499,999 women\nThis has never happened. Its relevance is nil.\n>Averages are useful, sure -- but much more so if called by their \n>actual name, rather than conflated with another concept.\nSo I chose not to type \"on average\" explicitly in my post, since this\nis FoRK and one tends to assume that people have a clue.\nThere is no disagreement between us, except that I am more interested\nin typical behaviour and you in extreme. Actually, you probably just\nhad a bad day and felt like jumping down my throat for the hell of it.\nEOT, AFAIC.\nR\n",
