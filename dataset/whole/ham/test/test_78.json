Second\noff, these are much easier to rip to divx and mp3. Third, new songs,\nremastered originals and other dvd goodies. Its a 2 dvd set so its well\nworth the 17$ we paid for it.\nEven if you dont have kids, run do not walk to pick this one up.\nMan, I would sure love to have a *nix Rocks for the kids.\n",
