For me that's only /etc/, /root/ and\n/home/. Then you reinstall cleanly, formating \"/\", put your /home/ files\nback into place and you're ready to go.\nThat's the moment I usually realize I had a nifty tweak to a file in\n/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ or some special parameters added to an\n/etc/modules.conf entry... so I look at my backup and make the same change\nagain. The only thing where you can get stuck is the grub.conf files,\nbecause although there's a /etc/grub.conf link, it's actually in\n/boot/grub/ so you may want to copy it too if you have special kernel\nparameters to save (I have to pass \"pci=bios,biosirq\" for one of my\ncomputers to work for example).\nHTH,\nMatthias\n-- \nMatthias Saou World Trade Center\n------------- Edificio Norte 4 Planta\nSystem and Network Engineer 08039 Barcelona, Spain\nElectronic Group Interactive Phone : +34 936 00 23 23\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\n",
