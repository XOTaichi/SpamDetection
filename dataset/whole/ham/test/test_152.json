Both the person who gives sex for\nmoney or power or companionship and the person\nwho uses money and power and companionship to\nget sex are promiscuous, in the broadest sense\nof the word. But their motives and behavior are\nquite different.\nLangur monkeys were the example in the cited\narticle. \"Dominant males .. kill babies that\nare not their own.\" \"The dominant male monkey\n.. seeks to defend his harem of females.\" But\ncozying up to the current dominant male isn't\nthe best strategy for female langurs, because\n\"dominant males are dethroned by rivals every\n27 months or so.\" \"By mating with as many\nextra-group males as possible, female langurs\nensure their offspring against infanticide,\"\nby the male who is likely next to rule the\nroost.\nMaybe it's just me, but that doesn't paint a\npicture of carefree females engaged in joyously\npromiscuous couplings. The dom cab driver who\nis taking her two boy toys to New Orleans is a\nbetter picture of that. ;-)\n_________________________________________________________________\nChat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: \n",
