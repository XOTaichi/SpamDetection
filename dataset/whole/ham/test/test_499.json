Paul Svensson\nis thinking harder about real people <wink> than the rest of us, and he may\nbe able to get use out of approaches that identify closely related spam.\nFor example, some amount of spam is going to end up in the ham training data\nin real life use, and any sort of similarity score to a piece of known spam\nmay be an aid in finding and purging it.\n",
