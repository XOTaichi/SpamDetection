    "body": "Here's a weird and wacky problem:\nI'm currently out of the country with my trusty Evo N600c laptop. When I \ntried to use the serial port to talk to my mobile phone, Linux behaved \npretty much as if the port was fried. Bizarre, I thought, because I'd \nused it successfully while in the office. The only difference was that I \nwas trying the thing in the hotel. I entertained brief notions of having \nsomehow fried the serial drivers, then rebooted the laptop to Windows \nand tried again. Worked perfectly. Back to Linux. Still not talking. \nConsidered that it might be flaky power, so I ran the laptop on battery. \nNope. Tried moving the laptop to a differnet part of the room where \nthere might be less bogon flux. Still not working. Eventually I gave up \nand used the IrDA port instead - which is usually the serial connection \nof doom, grief, and teeth-grinding.\nThis morning, in the office, the damn thing is working without a hitch.\nAnyone like to suggest what mystery technology is in use in the hotel \nthat prevents serial ports from working under Linux?\nCheers,\nWaider.\n-- \nwaider@waider.ie / Yes, it /is/ very personal of me\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\n for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n",
