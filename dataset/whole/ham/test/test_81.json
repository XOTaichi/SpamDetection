    "body": "Gordon Mohr quoted:\n># French Writer Tried As Anti-Islam, Protest Erupts\n># By Caroline Brothers\n>#\n># PARIS (Reuters) - Provocative French novelist Michel Houellebecq\n># faced a Paris court on Tuesday for allegedly inciting racial hatred\n># by calling Islam \"the stupidest religion\" and its holy book the\n># Koran a depressing read.\n>#\n># The case, brought against him by four Muslim groups, is a cause\n># celebre reminiscent of the Salman Rushdie affair, pitting freedom of\n># expression against religious sensitivities.\nVery reminiscent indeed. Ayatollah Chirac has decreed a death\nsentence on Houellebecq and liked-minded fundamentalists have offered\nmillions of euros bounty for his head, so he has gone into hiding\nunder police protection for a few years.\nOr maybe some handful of Muslims are acting uppity and dragging him to\ncourt under \"hate speech\" laws make a point about people not showin'\ndem da massive respect dat dey deserve, especially these days.\nOr maybe some journo is trying to fill column inches on a boring day.\nBTW I read Houellebecq's \"Extension du domaine de la lutte\" recently,\nabout a depressed computer services dude working in Paris, looking for\nlove and not finding it, slowing losing his marbles and trying to get\na friend of his to kill a woman, and ending up in a clinic for\nnutcases... Yikes! Purposely provocative, very depressing, with some\nunbelievably boring passages where the anti-hero writes little stories\nabout animals talking philosophical mumbo-jumbo to each other, quoted\ninline in full for pages on end.\nIt starts out:\n\"On Friday evening, I was invited to a party with some colleagues from\nwork. There were about thrity of us, all professionals aged from\ntwenty-five to forty. At one point, some cunt started getting\nundressed. She took off her T-shirt, then her bra, then her skirt, all\nthe while making unbelievable faces. She pranced around for a few\nseconds, then she started getting dresesd again because she didn't\nknow what else to do. Anyway she never sleeps with anyone. Which\nunderlines the absurdity of her behaviour.\nAfter my fourth glass of vodka I started to feel pretty bad so I had\nto go lie down on a bunch of cushions behind the couch. Shortly after\nthat, two girls came and sat on the couch. Those girls are not pretty\nat all, the two fat office cows actually. They go to eat together and\nread books about the development of language in children, all that\nsort of stuff.\"\n... and it's downhill from there!\nR\n",
