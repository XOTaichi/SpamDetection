Then in places like MsgChange, we only update the messages which have\nchanged.\nAlso, a separate Ftoc_ShowSequence function which only updates the display of \none sequence should be written which also takes an optional list of msgids. \nIn a place like MsgChange, it would only need to update the cur sequence.\nIf nobody else gets to it, I'll do this when I get back.\nChris\n-- \nChris Garrigues \nvirCIO \n716 Congress, Suite 200\nAustin, TX 78701\t\t+1 512 374 0500\n World War III: The Wrong-Doers Vs. the Evil-Doers.\n",
