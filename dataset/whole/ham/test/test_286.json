You do seem to have changed the \nlogs-to-c script and removed the bit where you could specify \nimmutable tests at the top -- I took a brief glance through the \ncode and couldn't fully make out how it had changed. I think we \nwant to be able to specify immutable test scores though in there \nsomewhere -- or is that now handled by the tflags stuff? For \nthe last couple releases, any test which occurred infrequently \n(by thumb-in-the-wind subjective criteria) I set to have \nimmutable scores, as well as a handful of other rules.\n> 5. kick off the GA\n>\n> BTW I'll be away this weekend at Linuxbierwanderung, so Craig, \n> you might\n> have to run the GA. ;)\nShouldn't be a problem.
