    "subject": "alsa-driver.spec tweak for homemade kernels",
    "body": "I use a mostly Red Hat 8.0 system, but prefer to configure and build my \nkernel by hand. I'd like to humbly offer a tweak to alsa-driver.spec \nthat helps it build cleanly under such circumstances. I recognize that \nfreshrpms.net packages are designed with standard Red Hat in mind, \nincluding a standard kernel RPM. However, I hope that Matthias will \nconsider the tweak small enough to justify its incorporation.\nThe diff is attached below. The first part of the diff contains a \nconditional that checks to see if the expected RPM is installed. If it \nis, %{karch} is set as before and a new %{krpm} flag is set to 1. If \nthe expected RPM is not installed, then %{karch} is instead set using \n\"uname -p\", while %{krpm} is left undefined.\nThe second part of the diff is simpler. We only require that \nkernel-source be installed if the kernel itself came from an RPM. (If \nthe kernel was hand-built, the presumably the user knows enough to have \nretained the sources in the expected place.)\nAgain, I realize that I'm operating \"off warrantee\" by not using a Red \nHat kernel RPM. Matthias, if you think this tweak is reasonable and not \ntoo ugly, I'd love to see you pick it up. If not, well at least this \nmessage will sit in the archives and may help other folks in the future.\n",
