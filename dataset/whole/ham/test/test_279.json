    "subject": "Missing the Point",
    "body": "URL: \nDate: Not supplied\nA lot of people seem to be missing the point of Phoenix, as evidenced by the \nresponses on Mozilla News[1] and MozillaZine[2]. Let me emphasize something \nhere: if you think Mozilla's current UI is acceptable, then you are clearly not \nthe target audience for Phoenix.\nHere is a quiz to test whether or not Phoenix is the right browser for you.\n- The link toolbar is: \n- critical to my day-to-day use \n- vital when using Bugzilla! Doesn't everybody use Bugzilla?\n- link what?\n- The sidebar is \n- indispensable since i run at 1600x1200 resolution \n- not cool enough, since i can't float and dock all my panels and have \nsplitters between all panels and see web page progress for individual HTML \npanels and check my email entirely from within sidebar and... \n- a waste of real estate\n- Form auto-fill \n- is not useful for me unless I can fill out 20 pages of personal information \nfirst \n- should just happen automatically\n- Downloads \n- should take place in a tree view with progress meters in the columns! \n- should be clearly visible and understandable.\n- Toolbars should \n- be dockable to all four corners of the screen, be able to float outside the \nwindow, be fully customizable such that I can make my own custom commands, be \nable to edit existing buttons' commands, be able to create my own toolbars, be \nable to put toolbars on the same line, and be able to edit the submenus and \ncontext menus of items (including the items on the menu bar) and browse my file \nsystem and cook me dinner and wash my car and walk my dog and do my taxes and \nmow my lawn and... \n- be customizable within reason\n- Composer should \n- always come with my browser. I want composer options all over my UI. \nEverywhere! \n- not be part of a Web browser.\n- Mail should \n- be part of my browser program. Aren't they the same app? There is a \ndifference? \n- be a separate application.\nNow to those people who want the full-blown functionality of the Mozilla trunk, \nyou can still get that with Phoenix. The idea is to relegate more features to \nthe \"optional add-on\" category. If you want the link toolbar or the sidebar or \nmouse gestures or any other features, you can download and install them \nyourself. I expect Phoenix will have a little add-in manager that will \nfacilitate this process. There is currently an expectation on the part of an \nalarming number of people that every feature implemented by anyone should \nautomatically be part of the default Mozilla install/download. \nWhy? \nA layered approach scales better. You can then have a browser that can become \nas complex as you want to make it, but the choice is left in your hands. The \ngeek features aren't inflicted on you by default.\nFinally, remember that Phoenix's UI is not controlled by Netscape. This is an \nopportunity for some of the core Mozilla Navigator developers to build the \nbrowser that they have always wanted to build, without having to compromise the \nuser interface to satisfy the various conflicting pressures exerted by factions \nwithin Netscape.\n[1] \n[2] \n",
