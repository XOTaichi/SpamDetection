I'd also prefer a\ncleaner way than the env variable, and preferrably not editing the spec...\nprobably \"--define 'target 2.4.xx-xx' --with smp\". Sound good enough?\nThe BuildRequires on \"kernel-source\" will also need to be removed because\nit won't necessarily need to be true, and that does bug me a bit :-/\nMore ideas are welcome.\nMatthias\n-- \nClean custom Red Hat Linux rpm packages : \nRed Hat Linux release 7.3 (Valhalla) running Linux kernel 2.4.18-10acpi\nLoad : 0.08 0.06 0.03\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\n",
