    "body": "\n[can't think of how I'd be running\nafoul of the spam filters with this\npost, so here's the second try...]\nKissinger's book _Does America Need\na Foreign Policy?_ provides a few\nhandy abstractions:\n> The ultimate dilemma of the statesman is to strike a balance between\n> values [\"idealism\"] and interests [\"realism\"] and, occasionally,\n> between peace and justice.\nAlso, he views historical American\napproaches to foreign policy as a\nbundle of three fibers:\nHamiltonian - We should only get\n involved in foreign adventures\n to preserve balances of power.\nWilsonian - We should only get\n involved in foreign adventures\n to further democracy, etc.\nJacksonian - We should never get\n involved in foreign adventures.\n Unless we're attacked. Then we\n go Rambo.\nHe has tactfully left out the hard\nrealists*; as for the rest I gather\nwilsonians play the idealists, and\nhamiltonians act where values and\ninterests intersect, and jacksonians \nact only when values and interests\noverlap.\nKissinger himself seems to be a\nHamiltonian; much of the book is\nabout how he thinks we ought to\nbe shaping the balance of power\nin various foreign regions.\nMaybe I've been too affected by\nKant, but I can't see that such\na strategy works unless one can\ncount on a Bismarck runnning it:\nhow lopsided does the US look if\neveryone tries to run a balance\nof power politics?\n- -Dave\n*\n> The road to empire leads to domestic decay because, in time, the claims\n> of omnipotence erode domestic restraints. No empire has avoided the\n> road to Caesarism unless, like the British Empire, it devolved its\n> power before this process could develop. In long-lasting empires,\n> every problem turns into a domestic issue [which should be handled\n> very differently from international ones] because the outside world\n> no longer provides a counterweight. And as challenges grow more\n> diffuse and increasingly remote from the historic domestic base,\n> internal struggles become ever more bitter and in time violent.\n> A deliberate quest for hegemony is the surest way to destroy the\n> values that made the United States great.\nKings and tyrants generically have\nfollowed the same power politics:\ngarner popular support by keeping\npotential oligarchs down. In other\ntraditions, a king is a legitimate\ntyrant, and a tyrant an illegitimate\nking. In the US, I'd hope that we,\nlike Samuel, wouldn't naturally make\nsuch fine distinctions.\n",
