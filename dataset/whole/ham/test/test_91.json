Note\nthat the tokenizer already *preserves* case in subject-line words, because\nexperiment showed that this was better than folding case away in this\nspecific context (but experiment also showed-- against my\nexpectations --that preserving case everywhere didn't make a significant\ndifference to either error rate -- the subject line is a special case for\nthis).\n",
