I'm not sure why it is important that the\nfirst message in the sequence returned exists, but not necessarily any\nof the others, but I'm sure glad it is, as MhSeqExpand gets called lots,\nand I don't know if I could cope if it were checking every file in the\nsequences it is looking at, all the time...\nIt may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current\nfolder (though that would then need to be verified against changes to the\ndirectory). Does tcl have a directory read function? I assume so...\nMh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the\ncontext file) but I'm not sure how frequently that one is called.\n | I'll email anything I figure out since I'm leaving town in less \n | than 48 hours.\nHave a good vacation.\nkre\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-workers mailing list\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\n",
