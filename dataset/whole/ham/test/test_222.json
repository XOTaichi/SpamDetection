Consider it on my list of things to check.\nWell, unfortunately, I appear to be using a window manager that doesn't \nsupport the icon window.\nHowever, I did fix some bugs in the related \"Hide When Empty\" functionality \nwhich may solve the issue. You may need to remove \"unseen\" from the \"always \nshow sequences\" to make this work. If so, let me know so I can put that in \nthe help window for \"Icon Window\" as it already is for \"Hide When Empty\".\nChris\n-- \nChris Garrigues \nvirCIO \n716 Congress, Suite 200\nAustin, TX 78701\t\t+1 512 374 0500\n World War III: The Wrong-Doers Vs. the Evil-Doers.\n",
