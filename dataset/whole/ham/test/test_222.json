Of course, \n this machine would have to be capable of VTOL, be easy to maintain, cost \n effective and reliable. Well, we at Moller International believe we have \n come up with the solution. That solution is the volantor named M400 Skycar. \n \nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Mark!_)\n[1] \n[2] \n",
