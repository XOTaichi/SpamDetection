I hit the same problem, but the other way round, when I first\nstarted playing with this - I'd collected spam for a week or two, \nthen mixed it up with randomly selected messages from my mail boxes.\ncourse, it instantly picked up on 'received:2001' as a non-ham. \nCurse that too-smart-for-me software. Still, it's probably a good\nthing to note in the documentation about the software - when collecting\nspam/ham, make _sure_ you try and collect from the same source.\nAnthony\n-- \nAnthony Baxter <anthony@interlink.com.au> \nIt's never too late to have a happy childhood.\n",
