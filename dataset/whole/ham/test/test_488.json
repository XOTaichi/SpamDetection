    "body": "URL: \nDate: Not supplied\nA new addition to the parodical genre of 419 (\"Nigerian Money Laundry Scam\") \nletters from members of the Shrub establishment, following up on Cheney's \nletter[1]. \n I am the widow of the late President George W. Bush of the United States of \n America. I am writing you this letter in confidence regarding my current \n circumstances. \n I escaped the United States ahead of death squads with my husband and two \n children Jenna and Frank, moving first to England and then, when my \n husband's political enemies took power there, to Austria. All of our \n wealth, obtained legitimately through baseball, oil drilling and insider \n trading, was seized by the new government of the USA under the despotic \n regime of (Dr.) Noam Chomsky, except for the contents of a few Swiss bank \n accounts. These bank accounts, which contain social security lock-box funds \n and the bulk of the 2001 budget surplus, could not be accessed by me or my \n children, due to agreements made between the socialist government of the \n USA and Swiss bank regulators. They seized our ranch in Crawford, Texas and \n now use it to teach homosexualist propaganda to schoolchildren. \nLink[2] Discuss[3] (_Thanks, Stefan!_)\n[1] \n[2] \n[3] \n",
