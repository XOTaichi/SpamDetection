The American public couldn't care\nless. However, the US intelligence community correctly perceives a\nthreat, and it isn't the third-world. Many European and other developed\nnations aggressively engage in covert operations against American\ninterests. Its been going on for years and isn't even news.

As with\nmost backwater wars, they are proxies for the interests of the big\nplayers.\nFind a current list of the top intelligence threats to the US. You'll\nfind that half the countries on that list are European.

The European governments ruthlessly suppress real opposition,\nobviously some more than others. US SpecOps are often brought in to do\ndirty work inside Europe for European governments (usually with\ngovernment \"advisors\" along for the mission). I've always wondered what\nthe deal was such that we got involved at all. The point being that\nwe've acted as assassins for European governments inside their borders\nagainst their own citizens under the auspices of those governments, and\nin recent years, not ancient history. I know SpecOp guys who left the\nmilitary specifically because of the circumstances of some of these\nmissions while they were posted for that duty. I'm certainly glad I was\nnever assigned missions in that theater, because there is a lot of\ncovert nastiness going on in nominally friendly European democracies.\nRegardless, giving money to people that threaten you has never created\nmeaningful peace in the history of civilization. We call it extortion\nunder any other guise.\n \n> A lot of the current EU - US issues can be explained by this difference \n> of perception, such as the current American unilateralism (nobody wants \n> to help us!), the American arrogance towards Europe (they don't want to \n> do anything, so why should we ask them?) and the growing rejection of the \n> American policy in Europe (they want to abolish the law!).\nEurope is looking increasingly like a basket case. Whatever problems\nthe US is having these days, Europe looks worse and is going downhill\nfaster. Why the US would want to emulate European behavior or the\nEuropean way of doing things is beyond me.\nThe US asking for major policy advice from Europe is like asking a quack\nfor medical advice. I really don't see what is wrong with \"unilateral\"\nanyway. Why should anyone join a stampede that is heading for a cliff?\nI hope the incessant knee-jerk conformist screeching that Americans see\ncoming from Europe doesn't actually represent the views of Europeans. \nFor various reasons I'm not exactly a cheerleader for the US government,\nbut the premises of the argument against them here are lame.\n> My personal point is that few Americans (percentage of overall population)\n> have ever left their country, while even German construction workers\n> regularly spend their holidays in Spain. So I'm not surprised that\n> paranoia is growing.\nI'm betting you are underestimating the actual percentage. The vast\nmajority of people I know have lived, worked, and traveled outside the\ncountry at one time or another. And I doubt Europeans have traveled\nanywhere near as much in the Western hemisphere as Americans have. \nDespite the best efforts of France, Europe is *still* not the center of\nthe universe. I'll throw you a bone though: most Americans do consider\nEurope to be drifting into irrelevancy and therefore ignore it. But\nfrom the perspective of an American, how could you NOT look at it this\nway? The impact of Europe on America has diminished greatly over the\nyears.\nI love the smell of Euro-chauvinism in the morning.\nFirst, you assume that the North American continent is ethnically and\nculturally homogenous. Anybody that has actually traveled throughout\nNorth America knows this isn't true; there are more than five major and\nvery distinct cultures and societies in the US alone, never mind the\nhundreds of diverse regional sub-populations, some of which are truly\nforeign. Apparently Europeans confuse speaking the same language with\nhaving the same culture. That would be like saying Mexico is culturally\nidentical to Spain because they nominally speak the same language. A\nWyoming rancher has almost nothing in common culturally or socially with\nyour average person living in San Francisco, despite speaking the same\nlanguage and nominally living in the same country. If I want to visit a\nwildly different culture for the holidays, I'll go to Oakland, New\nOrleans, or similar -- they are far more different from where I live\nthan some countries I've traveled to. And a lot of these places are\nfarther from where I live than Spain is from Germany.\nSecond, the State I live in is the size of Germany. When I travel to a\nneighboring State (which I do regularly), how is this not equivalent? \nIn fact, I probably travel much farther for the holidays than your\nGerman construction workers. If you look at the EU as a single country,\nonly then does your analogy become comparable. What kind of ridiculous\nsuperiority do Europeans get from having (relatively) tiny countries?\nIn truth, I find Europe to be about as culturally homogeneous as the\nUS. There are a lot of cultural similarities across the EU with\nrelatively minor local deviations that vary with distance in ways very\nsimilar to the US. The only real difference is that Europeans have\ndozens of different languages, which is hardly something I would call an\nadvantage. Although there are a couple parts of the US where I can't\nunderstand a word they are saying either. \n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n",
