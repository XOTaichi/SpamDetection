    "body": "Klez: The Virus That Won't Die\n \nAlready the most prolific virus ever, Klez continues to wreak havoc.\nAndrew Brandt\n>>From the September 2002 issue of PC World magazine\nPosted Thursday, August 01, 2002\nThe Klez worm is approaching its seventh month of wriggling across \nthe Web, making it one of the most persistent viruses ever. And \nexperts warn that it may be a harbinger of new viruses that use a \ncombination of pernicious approaches to go from PC to PC.\nAntivirus software makers Symantec and McAfee both report more than \n2000 new infections daily, with no sign of letup at press time. The \nBritish security firm MessageLabs estimates that 1 in every 300 \ne-mail messages holds a variation of the Klez virus, and says that \nKlez has already surpassed last summer's SirCam as the most prolific \nvirus ever.\nAnd some newer Klez variants aren't merely nuisances--they can carry \nother viruses in them that corrupt your data.\n...\n_______________________________________________\nIrregulars mailing list\nIrregulars@tb.tf\n",
