    "body": "URL: \nDate: Not supplied\nBarbie has been made over as a Bond girl: \n [IMG: As James Bond, Ken \n has matured nicely with rooted hair, with slight silvering at his temples, \n wearing a midnight blue tuxedo, and authentic recreation of the classic tux \n by Brioni, the famed clothier. Linda Hemming, the award winning costume \n designer in charge of this year's James Bond film, outfits Barbie doll. She \n wears a blood red gown with a glittering gold lace overlay and a gauzy red \n shawl with a gold filigree design. Her gown is cut up the side to reveal \n lots of leg as well as not so discreet hip strap that anchors Barbie's cell \n phone. The set is slated for release in November, to coincide with the \n premiere of \"Die Another Day,\" the new James Bond film. Bond, James Bond, \n meet Barbie, just Barbie... \nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks Derek!_)\n[1] \n[2] \n",
