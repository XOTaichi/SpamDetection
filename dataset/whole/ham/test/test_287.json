You don't have to. Short\nof Palladium, you can do whatever you want with bytes you hold, including\nreading messages and erasing the traces. I'll buy a chocolate sundae for\nanyone who can show otherwise.\nAn attacker might be able to verify that you *have* read a message (e.g. \nby seeing that you saved and edited a copy) but not that you *haven't*. \nIf your email client was compromised you could put a packet sniffer on the\nline before downloading mail. If an attacker installed a packet sniffer\nsniffer, you could run it in a spoofing VM.\nThe only exception to the rule that your machine belongs to you is --\nmaybe -- Palladium.\n- Lucas\n",
