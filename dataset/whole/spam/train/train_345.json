    "body": "Dear sir,,\nMy name is DR Steven M Duba , the son of MR. Theo\nDuba of Zimbabwe. I got your address from South\nAfrican Information exchange Johannesburg.\n.\nDue to the previous war against white farmers in\nZimbabwe by PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE and his supporters\nto claim all the white owned farms in our country, he\nordered all the White owned farmers to surrender all\ntheir farms to his party members and his followers. My\nfather was a victim of this oppression and inhuman\nbehavior as he was one of the richest farmers in our\ncountry,my fayher was totaly against the act by the\npresidnt MUGABE. The presidents supporters invaded my\nfathers farm, burnt everything in the farm, arrested\nhim and confiscated all his investment.\nEarly last year when this victimization of white\nfarmers by president Mugabe started, my late father\nenvisaged a worse situation, he arranged almost all\nhis money concealed it in a box and smuggled it out of\nZimbabwe through Diplomatic means to South Africa.\nWhen he arrived South Africa, he lodged the box in a\nprivate security company through the help of his\nlawyer here in South Africa without revealing the real\ncontents of the box to the security company, then,\nwent back home. He registered the box as family\ntreasure.\nWhile he was still in detention that led to his death\ndue to torture, he directed me to his lawyer in South\nAfrica because of the escalation of the crisis in\nZimbabwe. He did not want my life to be in danger. He\nwas arrested on the 5th of March last year.\nUnfortunately my dear father died on the 10th of\nDecember 2001.I came to south Africa March,2002.\nNow my stay here in Africa is frustrating and\ndepressing because my fathers lawyer is presently\nhospitalized in London due to terrible heart problem;\nthough the lodgment documents are with me, as such I\nwant to relocate to your country for good. Presently,\nmy residence permit here in South Africa is an Asylum\npermit as a refugee.\nI am seeking for your assistance in transferring the\nmoney in the security company (US$15 Million) out of\nthis country to your country for investment. If you\nthink you can help me, Please try to get in touch with\nme immediately with the number below . Your\ncompensation/share for assistance will be negotiated\nif you are ready to assist me. Since the problem in my\ncountry is still lingering, please endeavor to keep\nthis information to yourself and secret, because I\nwouldnt want anything that will expose me, and the\nexistence of this money.\nYour urgent response will be highly appreciated.\nSincerely yours,\nSTEVEN DUBA (DR).\nTEL:27-83-713-2696\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
