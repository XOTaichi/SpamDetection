This \nmoney was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled as\npersonal belongings and as such the security company does \nnot know the true content of the boxes.This money was \noriginally meant to be used for his political campaign. \nBecause I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me \nwith the relevant document papers relating to this deposit \nbefore he died of cardiac arrest.\nAs a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with \nan offshore Security Company to move this money as a \nconsignment through diplomatic means to their offshore \naffiliated office where you will be required to put claim \nto the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the \nconsignment. You should know that this business is safety \nand 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or \nTerrorist fund.\n \nIf you are interested to carry out this transaction with \nme, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general \nexpenses, and 75% for us.\nYou are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full \nname and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement \nthat will guide and protect both of us in this transaction \nalso which will be used to effect the change of ownership \nof the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the \nconsignment.\nAlso send me your Telephone and Fax numbers for easy \ncommunication\n \nOnce you notify me your willingness by sending the above \nrequirement.This transaction will be concluded within 7 \n(seven) working days.\nI will be waiting for your urgent reply.You can reach me on \nmy Cell Telephone No: 234-80- 33055024 or my alternative E-\nmail: williamsfalana@caramail.com \nBest regards, \nBarrister Williams Falana {SAN} \n______________________________________________________\nBo√Æte aux lettres - Caramail - \n",
