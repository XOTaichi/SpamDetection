    "body": "OWOLABI & ASSOCIATE,\nFALOMO, IKOYI.\nLAGOS - NIGERIA.\nYOUR KIND ATTN.,\nRE: REQUEST FOR MUTUALLY BENEFITTING ENDEAVOUR.\nI humbly crave your indulgence in sending you this\nmail, if the contents does not meet with your personal\nand business ethics, I apologize in advance.\nI am Barrister Kola Owolabi( attorney at law), I\nrepresent Alhaji Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzoâ€™s estates. Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief\nsecurity advicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the\nperson of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. With the\nadvent of a new democratic\ndispensation in the country under the leadership of\nGen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come under\nsevere persecution due to the sensitive position he\nheld in the last military regime, presently he is\nunder house arrest restricted only to the confines of\nhis village.\nThe main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a\nbusiness proposal that might be of interest to you. My\nclient has informed me of the existence of funds\ndeposited with a security company abroad. This fund\ncame about as part of security votes that were\nallocated to my client's portfolio during his tenure\nas chief security adviser to the then president. What\nhappened was that he had part of the funds transferred\nfrom the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this\nsecurity outfit with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal\nsecurity outfit of the\nthen president. But before the purchase could take\nplace the president died. My client has decided to\nkeep this for himself as all his properties has been\nconfisticated by the present regime. But due to his\nincarceration he cannot travel out and effect the\nchange of possession to his benefit.\nI have been mandated by my client to source for a\nforeign partner that can help him facilitate the\nchange of possession. The deposit certificate and the\ncode needed for the execution of this endeavor are in\nmy possession.\nThe funds in question is USD17.6M (Seventeen Million, Six Hundred Thousand\nUnited States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of interest to you, you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we can go through the rudiments of this endeavor.\nI remain most obliged.\nBarrister Kola Owolabi(JP).\nPrincipal Partner. Owolabi & Associates\n__________________________________________________________________\nYour favorite stores, helpful shopping tools and great gift ideas.
