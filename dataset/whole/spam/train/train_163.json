This sum \n(US$71.5M) is an over \ninvoice contract sum which is currently in an offshore \npayment account of the Central Bank \nof Nigeria as an \nunclaimed contract entitlement which can easily be \nwithdrawn or drafted or pay to any \nrecommended \nbeneficiary by my committee.\nOn this note, you will be presented as a contractor to \nNEPA who has executed a contract \nto a tune of the\nabove sum and has not been paid. \nProposed Sharing Partern (%): \n1. 70% for me and my colleagues. \n2. 20% for you as a partner/fronting for us.\n3. 10% for expenses that may be incurred by both parties \nduring the cause of this \ntransacton.\nOur law prohibits a civil servant from operating a \nforeign account, hence we are contacting \nyou. If this\nproposal satisfies you, do respon as soon as possible \nwith the following information: \n1. The name you wish to use as the beneficiary of the \nfund. \n2. Your Confidential Phone and Fax Numbers. \nFurther discussion will be centered on how the fund shall \nbe transfer and full details on how \nto accomplish this \ngreat opportunity of ours.\nThank you and God bless. \nBest regards, \nGeorge Osawa \n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\n for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n",
