    "body": "Hi -\n( )\nYou get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.\nMost of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.\nAnd they expect you to listen to them?\nEnough.\nIf you want to make money with your computer, then you should\nhook up with a group that is actually DOING it. We are making\na large, continuing income every month. What's more - we will\nshow YOU how to do the same thing.\nThis business is done completely by internet and email, and you\ncan even join for free to check it out first. If you can send\nan email, you can do this. No special \"skills\" are required.\nHow much are we making? Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.\nWe are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.\nBut keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to \ninsult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,\nand rake in the cash. That kind of job does not exist. But if\nyou are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be\njust the thing you are looking for.\nThis is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is\ndone FOR you - it is all based on your effort. But, as I said,\nthere are no special skills required. And this income is RESIDUAL -\nmeaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase\neach month also).\nInterested? I invite you to find out more. You can get in as a\nfree member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you\ndecide it is not for you. We are just looking for people who still\nhave that \"burning desire\" to find an opportunity that will reward\nthem incredibly well, if they work at it.\nTo grab a FREE ID# and have more information, simply go to the \n web address and send me an email with following \n informtion\n\"Send me a free membership!\"\nBe sure to include your:\n1. First name\n2. Last name\n3. Email address (if different from above)\nWe will confirm your position and send you a special report\nas soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number.\nIf you are not interested in tring to Earn Money, :)\nyou are interested in the huge discount from the 140 Online Shops,\nVery Cheap ISP package and many many more,\nYou can also go to the web address:\n/#id-GreatService\nThat's all there's to it.\nWe'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\nSincerely, \nHugh Zou\nP.S. After having several negative experiences with network\nmarketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.\nThis is different - there is value, integrity, and a\nREAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...\nand finally make real money on the internet.\nDon't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the\nprogram for FREE. All you need to do is get your free\nmembership.\nUnsubscribing: Send a blank email to: removemefromlist@bigfoot.com with\n\"Remove\" in the subject line. By submitting a request for a FREE\nDHS Club Membership, I agree to accept email from the DHS Club for\nboth their consumer and business opportunities.\n3619ezfT0-011VpTm2924l20\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\n for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n",
